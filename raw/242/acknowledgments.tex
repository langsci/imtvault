\addchap{Acknowledgments}

This book grew out of an interest in what initially seemed to be a couple of unrelated puzzles in the grammars of certain Slavic languages and Latvian. As the work on each of them progressed, it became clearer and clearer that they in fact all boil down to the way the syn-sem representations specific to each domain under the investigation become realized as morphology. This work presents the puzzles and the steps taken to bring us at least minimally closer to finding explanations for them.

Parts of the material discussed in this work were presented at colloquia held at the Department of Slavic at Humboldt University in Berlin in May 2017 and at the Institute of Linguistics at the University of Wuppertal in May 2018, as well as at the Olomouc Linguistics Colloquium (Olinco) held at Palack\'y University in Olomouc in June 2018, and at the \textit{Exploring Nanosyntax} session at the annual LSA meeting held in New York in January 2019. I am indebted to the participants of these meetings for feedback and discussions. None of the material presented in this book has been published elsewhere, but an earlier report outlining the research on the demonstratives in Slavic and in Basa\'a which is developed here has been posted at LingBuzz as part of an unpublished collection of squibs in a festschrift for Michal Starke (\citealt{WilandTUM}).
