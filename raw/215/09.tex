\title{Extraction from DP in French: A minimalist approach}

\abstract{This article is about the extraction of French PP complements of nouns headed by \textit{de}, mostly in \textit{wh} and relative clause contexts. After a review of the literature on extraction in French, it addresses the issue of the constraints on extraction in cases with multiple arguments, eventually following \citet{Kolliakou1999} in assuming that there can only be one argument of a noun, whereas other expressions are adjuncts. I then explain the relevant extractions within the Minimalist Program: on the assumption that DPs are phases, an extracted item must first move to the phase edge, as assumed in previous accounts. The exact extraction mechanism is then modeled by assuming a phi-probe plus an unvalued operator feature on the D head. The fact that only complements introduced by the preposition \textit{de} can be extracted from the DP is explained by considering \textit{de} as a post-syntactic marking for genitive case, which is assigned by the phi-probe.}

\subsection{Aims and organization of the article}% 1.1 

This article readdresses the extraction of elements from a DP, which has been a topic for the last fifty years or so within the context of long-distance dependencies and DP islands (cf. \citealt{Ross1967}; \citealt{Sportiche1981}; \citealt{Huang1982}; \citealt{Obenauer1985Connectedness,Obenauer1985identification,Obenauer1994}; \citealt{Chomsky1986Barriers}; \citealt{Cinque1990}; \citealt{Szabolcsi2006}, among many others). I concentrate on \ili{French}, a language for which the phenomena at issue have been intensely discussed within generative grammar, in particular in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g. by \citealt{Tellier1990}; \citealt{Sportiche1981}; \citealt{Obenauer1994}; \citealt{Pollock1989}; \citealt{Valois1991}; \citealt{Godard1992}). Before going into the reasons that motivate my reopening this debate, let me illustrate the structures that I am interested in.

The examples in (1a–b) illustrate a complex DP island and a subject island, respectively. These structures involve the extraction of a constituent (in this case a \textit{wh} element) from a deeply embedded syntactic region (usually a clause) within a DP, or from a DP that is a subject. Extractions from complex DP islands and subject islands are usually considered as ungrammatical in all languages and are not the focus of this article.\footnote{The subject condition does not hold for all subjects, but mainly for subjects of transitive and unergative verbs; cf. e.g. \citet[153–154]{Chomsky2008} (see \citealt{Broekhuis2005}: 64–65 for discussion); for \ili{French} cf. \citet[90]{Tellier1991}. For other exceptions, see \citet{Truswell2005} and the references mentioned there, in particular with respect to “possessor extraction”, to which the \ili{French} cases mentioned by \citet{Tellier1990} for the relative element \textit{dont} (also cf. \citealt{Heck2008,Heck2009}) can be argued to belong. \citet{Stepanov2007} claims that subject islands are not universal, in contrast to \isi{adjunct} islands.} Instead, I will be mostly concerned with cases like those in (2), i.e. the extraction of a PP from a complement or \isi{adjunct} DP. Without considering the status of the PP for now, the data in (2a–d) suggest that, in \ili{French}, extraction of a PP that contains a \textit{wh} element is grammatical when the PP is headed by the \isi{preposition} \textit{de} and ungrammatical with other \is{preposition}prepositions. These facts also apply to relative clauses:\footnote{And, in addition, to focusing via fronting (if available) and clefting, see (23c) and Footnote 17 in §4.}

\footnotetext{\ili{French} has a relative \isi{complementizer} \textit{que}, which cannot be used after \is{preposition}prepositions and is thus irrelevant here. After \is{preposition}prepositions, we find the relative pronoun \textit{lequel} (fem.: \textit{laquelle}, plur.: \textit{lesquels/lesquelles}), which combines with the \isi{preposition} \textit{de} in the masculine singular and in the plural forms (\textit{duquel}, \textit{desquel(le)s}). The element \textit{dont} is invariable and equivalent to \textit{duquel}, \textit{de laquelle}, \textit{desquel(le)s}, thus representing a kind of relative pro-PP. In addition, for persons, \textit{de} \textit{qui} ‘of whom’ can be used. I will assume here that relative pronouns move to [spec,CP], pied-piping the \isi{preposition} (i.e. the whole PP moves). I will not consider \citegen{Kayne1994} raising-analysis of relative clauses, nor the idea that \textit{dont} might better be analyzed as a \isi{complementizer}. However, my approach presented in §4 can easily be made compatible with these theories.}

As we shall see, this first rough approximation needs some refinement, and, in addition, problems arise when the DP contains more than one PP headed by \textit{de}, as shown in (4a,b) from Milner (\citeyear{Milner1978,Milner1982}; quoted in \citealt{Sag1994}). Although the relative element \textit{dont} is generally exempt from the subject condition mentioned above,\footnote{See Footnote 1.} as shown by the grammaticality of (4a), the example in (4b) is ungrammatical:

Similar facts can also be observed when extraction takes place from a direct object. There have been several proposals in the literature mostly assuming a thematic hierarchy (such as, e.g., \citealt{Pollock1989}; \citealt{Godard1992}), but this problem has never been fully resolved. The goals of this article are (i) to readdress the question of which constituent can be extracted in cases like (4) by adapting a very promising approach by \citet{Kolliakou1999}, which was formulated within the HPSG framework and has never been considered in the minimalist literature; (ii) to explain the extraction mechanism within a minimalist \isi{probe-goal} approach (following \citealt{Chomsky2000} et seq.). Both goals are connected in the following sense: Kolliakou’s approach assumes that, when there is more than one PP headed by \textit{de} in a DP, only one is an argument and the other one is an \isi{adjunct} (in particular, a property-denoting expression, see \citealt{Chierchia1982,Chierchia1985}), which cannot be extracted. But since there is no general ban in UG against the extraction of \is{adjunct}adjuncts, a minimalist analysis must be able to predict this property of extractions from DP. The approach I suggest at the end of the article builds on the old idea that cyclic movement must use [spec,DP] as an ``escape hatch'' (cf. among others \citealt{Gavruseva2000}, following older ideas that go back to \citealt{Cinque1980}). In the \isi{Minimalist} Program, this means that the DP is a phase (see, e.g. \citealt{Heck2008,Heck2009}, among others), and consequently, extractions must pass through its \is{phase!phase edge}phase edge. In the constructions at issue, [Spec,DP] acts as a kind of filter that admits only argumental DPs. In a framework such as \citeauthor{Chomsky2000} (\citeyear{Chomsky2000} et seq.), argumental DPs must be identified by an unvalued \is{case!case feature}case feature. In my approach, this \is{case!case feature}case feature is checked and valued as [genitive] by the D head, which leads me to adopt a view that treats ‘genitive’ \textit{de} in \ili{French} as a kind of case marker rather than a \isi{preposition}.\largerpage[-1]

This article is organized as follows. In the rest of the introduction (§1.2), I explain the framework I adopt (in particular concerning A’-movement in a probe-and-goal-based approach). In §2, I present some of the basic data at stake and summarize the discussions that took place within the GB framework. I then turn to \citegen{Kolliakou1999} explanation of the data shown in (4) and finally develop a tree structure that is compatible with Kolliakou’s view. §3 summarizes two articles (\citealt{Gutiérrez-Bravo2001}; \citealt{Cinque2014}) that analyze data from \ili{Spanish} and \ili{Italian}, respectively, using phase-based approaches, which are not, however, formulated according to the feature-checking system of \citeauthor{Chomsky2000} (\citeyear{Chomsky2000} et seq.). Nevertheless, both solutions offer some important insights, namely that the mechanism for extraction of material from within a DP is related to the assignment of \is{case!genitive case}genitive case in \ili{Romance}, and that movement to the \is{phase!phase edge}phase edge of DP at least partially involves properties of A-movement. In §4 I develop my own analysis, arguing that the data at issue can be explained straightforwardly by applying Chomsky’s (2000 et seq.) \isi{probe-goal} mechanism, and, ultimately, by the feature composition of \ili{French} D heads. In particular, my proposal amounts to saying that D heads contain two phi probes, one that is responsible for agreement between D and the N head, and another one that takes the complement of N as a goal, valuing its unvalued \is{case!case feature}case feature as [genitive]. This second probe has an optional unvalued operator feature that comes with an [EPP]-feature, which ultimately licenses the extraction. The article ends in §5 with some conclusions. Note that most of the ingredients of my own approach can be found elsewhere, but, as far as I can see, this is the first time that they have been coherently put together using the machinery assumed in a modern minimalist framework.\largerpage[-1]

\subsection{Theoretical framework}% 1.2 

For the minimalist analysis, I assume \is{phase!phase theory}phase theory and the \isi{probe-goal} approach of \citeauthor{Chomsky2000} (\citeyear{Chomsky2000} et seq.). According to \is{phase!phase theory}phase theory, syntactic structure is built up in a step-wise fashion, where some categories (such as v and C, but crucially not T) are so-called \is{phase!phase head}phase heads. Every time such a \is{phase!phase head}phase head has projected its full structure (vP, CP), the phase domain (which is the whole complement of the relevant \is{phase!phase head}phase head) is sent to Spell-Out and is therefore not available for further syntactic operations.\footnote{Ultimately, this follows from the \textit{Phase Impenetrability Condition} (PIC). For the cases at issue here, it is irrelevant whether we adopt the version of \citet[108]{Chomsky2000} or \citet[13–14]{Chomsky2001Derivation}.}

Movement of elements related to the case-agreement system is implemented by unvalued \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features on a functional head. Such features are called probes, which search the tree downward (under \isi{c-command}) for a matching goal (valued \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features). A valid goal is identified by an unvalued \is{case!case feature}case feature. Matching of features triggers the operation \isi{Agree}, which basically consists of three steps: (i) the probe’s unvalued \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features receive the values of the goal; (ii) the goal’s unvalued \is{case!case feature}case feature is valued according to the nature of the head that bears the probe (e.g., [Nom] in the case of T, [Acc] in the case of v, and – as I will argue – [Gen] in the case of D); (iii) the goal is licensed for movement, which takes place if the category that bears the probe has an [EPP]-feature (essentially an instruction to project a specifier) that is not checked otherwise (e.g. by an expletive). In this article, I will not consider further elaborations of the \isi{probe-goal} framework such as \citet{Pesetsky2007} or \citet{Zeijlstra2012}, although my solution can be easily implemented in these and other frameworks.

The \isi{probe-goal} approach has also been extended to A’-movement. I will here use a system adapted from \citet[419ff.]{Radford2004}, who assumes that the target category of A’-movement bears a probe consisting of an \is{feature!uninterpretable feature}uninterpretable operator feature (uOp) and an [EPP] feature, while the item undergoing movement has an interpretable operator feature, with values such as [\textit{wh}], [rel(ative)] or [focus]. \citet{Chomsky2007,Chomsky2008} assumes that, instead of [EPP]-features, \is{phase!phase head}phase heads can optionally have other movement-inducing features, so-called edge features (EFs), which do not depend on a \isi{probe-goal} relationship. In particular, a \is{phase!phase head}phase head can have an EF when it can trigger a movement step that causes some effect, e.g. a necessary intermediate movement step in order for the derivation to converge (cf. \citealt[149]{Chomsky2008}, \citealt{Mueller2010deriving}). The idea of EFs has been criticized in the literature, among other reasons because, since optional EFs (or P(eripheral)-features in earlier minimalist work) are held to be a universal property, it is difficult in such a framework to model cross-linguistic variation (cf. \citealt{Ceplova2001}; \citealt{Boeckx2007}; \citealt{Boeckx2011}, among others). Thus, “[d]ifferent domains count as opaque in different languages; it makes sense to look for features that vary cross-linguistically and that may induce islandhood” \citep[4]{Boeckx2011}. In the cases to be discussed in the present article, the variation at issue is even intra-linguistic, i.e. within the same language. If the (un)grammaticality of the \ili{French} cases presented in §1.1 is due to the phase property of DP, as I assume, in a case such as (2a), movement of [\textsubscript{PP} \textit{sur qui}] to the DP-\is{phase!phase edge}phase edge would be needed to make the derivation converge, and thus an EF could be freely generated on the D° head. However, the structure is ungrammatical, which calls the EF approach into question. I therefore assume a \isi{probe-goal} approach for A’-movement as sketched above, in the sense that the D head contains an [EPP]-feature bound to a probe that is sensitive to particular kinds of features.

\section{Basic data and state of the art}% 2. 
\largerpage[2]
As I have already mentioned in §1.1, a PP can be extracted from a complement DP in \textit{wh} and relative constructions when the PP is headed by \textit{de}, as is illustrated again in (5) and (6):

However, as observed by \citet[225]{Sportiche1981}, extraction is barred when the \isi{preposition} \textit{de} indicates source/origin (also cf. \citealt{Tellier1991}: 90):\largerpage

    \z
\z

Taking this together with the observation made in §1.1, according to which PPs headed by \is{preposition}prepositions other than \textit{de} cannot be extracted either, \citet{Sportiche1981} arrives at the descriptive generalization in (8) for extractable constituents:

\begin{exe}
\ex%8
\label{ex:mensch:8}
Provisional descriptive generalization (I)\\
\noindent “Class 1: genitive PP’s [sic] introduced by the \isi{preposition} ‘de’.

Class 2: PP’s introduced by other \is{preposition}prepositions (including the one homophonous to ‘de’ indicating the source).

[...] the second class of PP’s is, in general, not wh-extractable. [...] However, PP’s in the first class sometimes are; PP’s in this class introduce either the object of the head noun, its subject or its possessor (if possible).” \citep[225]{Sportiche1981}
\end{exe}

Note by the way that Sportiche calls the extractable PPs ``genitive PPs'', which he further divides into those representing “the object of the head noun, its subject or its possessor”, corresponding to the traditional division into objective, subjective and possessive genitives. In the literature published after \citet{Sportiche1981}, we observe two tendencies. First, phrases introduced by \textit{de} are considered to be arguments, whereas phrases introduced by other \is{preposition}prepositions are taken to be \is{adjunct}adjuncts, to which those headed by \textit{de} indicating source/origin can also be argued to belong (cf. \citealt{Cinque1990}; \citealt{Moritz1994}; \citealt[586]{Alexiadou2007Noun}). Second, the terms subject, object and possessor were replaced by the \is{theta-role}theta-roles \AGENT, \THEME and \POSSESSOR (e.g. \citealt{Pollock1989}; \citealt{Valois1991}; \citealt{Godard1992}). Crucially, \is{theta-role}theta-roles were argued to be responsible for determining which constituent can be extracted in the case of multiple PPs headed by \textit{de}:

The examples in (9) are about a portrait featuring a young lady (\THEME) painted by Corot (\AGENT). The distinction between (9a) and (9b) is supposed to show that, when there is an \AGENT and a \THEME in the same DP, the \AGENT can be extracted and the \THEME cannot. Similar facts seem to apply to (10), where the presence of a \POSSESSOR seems to block the extraction of an \AGENT. This was assumed to follow from the following thematic hierarchy: \POSSESSOR > \AGENT > \THEME (cf. \citealt{Pollock1989}; \citealt{Godard1992}). Let us assume this for now, so that the descriptive generalization in (8) can be replaced by the one in (11):

\begin{exe}
\ex%11
    \label{ex:mensch:11}
Provisional descriptive generalization (II):\\
          Argument PPs of nouns can be extracted if they
          
            \begin{itemize}
                \item are introduced by \textit{de} and
                \item bear the \isi{theta-role} \AGENT, \THEME or \POSSESSOR.
            \end{itemize}
If the noun has more than one complement, only the highest in the hierarchy  \POSSESSOR > \AGENT > \THEME can be extracted. Adjunct PPs cannot be extracted.
\end{exe}

However, \citet[160]{Pollock1989} mentions some exceptions, in which the \THEME is extractable even when an \AGENT is expressed:

    \z
\z

As \citet[268, Footnote 31]{Godard1992} observes (for 12c), “the complement \textit{du Monde} is a modifier rather than an argument; it is interpreted as a location, equivalent to the RC ``which appeared in Le Monde{''}”. In a similar vein, \citet[86–87, Footnote 2]{Milner1982} remarks that, in an expression such as \textit{La symphonie de Beethoven de Karajan} (lit. ‘The symphony of Beethoven of Karajan’), it is not obvious that \textit{Beethoven} is an authentic \AGENT, whereas one might consider \textit{symphonie de Beethoven} as a kind of \isi{compound noun}, of which \textit{Karajan} would be the only complement.

Such considerations led \citet{Kolliakou1999} to the conclusion that, in all the examples at stake – i.e. such as those in (9), (10), and (12) – there is only one argument PP in the DP.\footnote{Also cf. \citet[93]{Cinque2014}, who arrives at similar conclusions for \ili{Italian}, cf. Footnote 11.} Her basis is Chierchia's (\citeyear{Chierchia1982,Chierchia1985}) distinction between IDPs (\textit{individual-denoting phrases}), i.e. phrases denoting individuals that refer to an entity in discourse, and PDPs (\textit{property-denoting phrases}), i.e. phrases denoting properties that determine a type of entity. When there is more than one PP headed by \textit{de} in a DP, there can only be one IDP, whereas the other one is necessarily a PDP. Consider the examples in (13) from \citet[736]{Kolliakou1999}:\largerpage[1]

\ea%13
    \label{ex:mensch:13}
    \ea
    \gll En ce moment,  \textit{une}  \textit{attaque}  \textit{de}  \textit{partisans}  serait  fatale. (PDP)\\

    \glt ‘At this moment a partisan attack would be fatal.’
    \ex  
    \gll \textit{L’} \textit{attaque}  \textit{des}  \textit{partisans}  a  commencé  à {7 heures}. (IDP)\\
         the attack  of.the  partisans  has  begun    at {7 o’clock}\\
    \glt ‘The attack of the partisans began at 7 o’clock.’

    \glt ‘The attack of (the) partisans this morning wasn’t a partisan attack.’
    \z
\z

Actually, the \ili{French} expression \textit{une attaque de partisans} can be translated into \ili{English} either as ‘an attack by partisans’ or as ‘a partisan attack’, where, in the latter case, \textit{partisans} cannot be interpreted as an \AGENT, but designates a property; thus, a \textit{partisan attack} is an attack that is typical for partisans. As Kolliakou observes, such PDPs are \is{adjunct}adjuncts, whereas only IDPs can act as arguments. In \ili{French}, there are no \isi{compound noun}compound expressions of the \ili{English} type, but the PDP can sometimes be substituted for by a corresponding \isi{adjective}; e.g. in (12a) \textit{l’interprétation de Karajan} could be paraphrased by \textit{interprétation} \textit{karajanienne}, a test which shows that \textit{de Karajan} is a PDP. That fact that PDPs behave like post-nominal \is{adjective}adjectives confirms the idea that such expressions are \is{adjunct}adjuncts. Importantly, Kolliakou also observes that, in cases without extraction, the PDP is closer to the head noun than the argument (IDP). This is illustrated in (14), from \citet[714]{Kolliakou1999}, which also shows the interaction of syntax with extra-linguistic factors, in this case world knowledge:\largerpage[2]

\ea%14
    \label{ex:mensch:14}

\z    

(14b) is not accepted because, syntactically, \textit{de Monsieur X} is closer to the head noun than \textit{de Le Corbusier}, which means that it must be interpreted as a PDP-\isi{adjunct} and not as a possessor argument. The unacceptability then results from the fact that, without a very specific context, there is no such thing as a typical “Mr. X house”. Just like some putative agents or possessors, apparent themes can also qualify as PDPs. Thus, the ungrammaticality of (9a) also falls into place if \textit{le portrait de la jeune femme de Corot} is interpreted as something like ‘the young woman-portrait of/by Corot’.\footnote{The status of an expression as either an IDP or a PDP often depends on world knowledge. For further illustration, see \citegen{Kolliakou1999} remarks concerning (i) and (ii):

    \noindent“[\textit{D}]\textit{’Aristote} in [(i)] is different from \textit{d’Aristote} in [(ii)]: \textit{portrait} \textit{d’Aristot}\textit{e}\textbf{ }in [(i)] can identify a typical portrait representing Aristotle (or even a typical Aristotle portrait depicting someone else); on the other hand, \textit{d’Aristo}\textit{te} in [(ii)] refers to an individual named ‘Aristotle’, and who in principle can be associated in one out of many ways with the portrait (painter, owner, etc.) – provided we leave aside the historical/``meta-linguistic'' information that biases our interpretation” \citep[748]{Kolliakou1999}.}

On these grounds, let us reject the descriptive generalization in (11) and, instead, adopt (15):

\begin{exe}
\ex%15
    \label{ex:mensch:15}
Descriptive generalization (III)

\begin{itemize}
\item A noun can select only one PP argument headed by the \isi{preposition} \textit{de}, usually expressing \AGENT, \THEME or \POSSESSOR. This argument can be extracted in \textit{wh} and relative constructions.
\item Other PPs headed by \textit{de} (including those indicating \SOURCE and \linebreak PDPs), as well as PPs headed by other \is{preposition}prepositions, are \is{adjunct}adjuncts. Adjuncts cannot be extracted in \textit{wh} and relative constructions.
\end{itemize}
\end{exe}


Kolliakou herself uses an HPSG account to derive the structures at issue in this section. Note that her theories about arguments and PDP-adjuncts in the DP can easily be expressed in a minimalist framework. I cannot discuss here the numerous proposals for the internal structure of DPs and the position of post-verbal \is{adjective}adjectives in \ili{Romance}. A quite widespread approach is to assume one or more functional projections between DP and NP (cf. the discussion in \citealt{Alexiadou2007Noun}), represented as FP in the simplified version in (16) representing (14a):

\ea%16

\end{forest}
\z


Here, the noun \textit{maison} has one argument, to which the \isi{theta-role} \POSSESSOR is assigned. The other PP, the PDP de \textit{Le Corbusier} is an \isi{adjunct}, left-adjoined to NP. The head noun is raised to a functional projection (maybe NumP). It follows naturally from this analysis that the PDP \isi{adjunct} is closer to the head noun, in conformity with what Kolliakou observes.

However, all this does not explain why the \isi{adjunct} cannot be extracted and how the extraction of the complement can be modeled within the \isi{Minimalist} Program. I will solve these problems within the account that I will develop in §4, but let us first look at some more recent work in which the DP is considered as a phase.

\section{Phase-based approaches}% 3. 

The idea that cyclic movement uses [spec,DP] (or [spec,NP] in former frameworks) as an “escape hatch” can already be found in \citet{Cinque1980} and has been elaborated on, e.g., by \citet{Stowell1989,Szabolcsi1983,Giorgi1991}, and \citet{Gavruseva2000}. In more recent work, the DP has been considered to be a phase (cf. e.g. \citealt{Svenonius2004}; \citealt{Chomsky2008}; \citealt{Heck2008,Heck2009}). For data concerning extractions from DP that are similar to those considered here, originating from \ili{Spanish} and \ili{Italian}, respectively, I briefly summarize \citet{Gutiérrez-Bravo2001} and \citet{Cinque2014}.

\citet{Gutiérrez-Bravo2001} is a surprisingly early article on \is{phase!phase theory}phase theory, which, however, still follows \citet{Chomsky1995} with respect to (strong and weak) features, checking theory, and agreement. The \ili{Spanish} data that this article aims to explain are similar to the \ili{French} data in §2:

    \glt ‘Of what did you lose Juan’s translation \_\_?’}

\z

As shown in (18) below, Gutiérrez-Bravo assumes an AgrGen[itive] projection situated lower than D. In order to attract the \textit{wh} constituent to the \is{phase!phase edge}phase edge, the D head has a strong [\textit{wh}]-feature. The covert AgrGen head has a genitive feature, which is adjoined to D. This feature will then attract the PP that also bears a [GEN]-feature to [Spec,DP] (recall that, in Chomsky’s 1995 framework, features are checked via specifier-head agreement). The attracted PP must also bear a [\textit{wh}]-feature, which checks the [\textit{wh}]-feature of D. Within the NP, a PP that encodes the \AGENT is merged in [Spec,NP], whereas the PP bearing the \THEME \isi{theta-role} is the complement of N. The ungrammatical case (17b) is then explained by the Minimal Link Condition, which forces the [GEN] feature in D to attract the closest constituent that also bears a [GEN] feature. In (17b), this would be the PP \textit{de Juan}, which does not, however, bear a [\textit{wh}]-feature. For (17a), the derivation would converge in the following way:

\end{forest}}%
\end{exe}

Apart from the fact that this account uses an early minimalist framework, it contains some weak points. For example, the adjunction of the [GEN]-feature is not motivated, and questions arise concerning how the second genitive feature (on the N complement in (18)) is checked, and why a PP can bear a \is{case!case feature}case feature in the first place. However, Gutiérrez-Bravo’s approach contains an interesting point: the incorporation of the \is{case!case feature}case feature into D creates a complex D head that has both A and A’ properties. In other words, the extraction from DP “is conditioned by the possibility of the extracted constituent to check the Case feature of the adjoined functional head” (\citealt{Gutiérrez-Bravo2001}: 116).

In a similar vein, \citet[23]{Cinque2014} assumes, for parallel \ili{Italian} data, that “DPs are phases (which forces movement to the highest specifier of DP, before extraction takes place)”. He argues that this specifier is an A- (rather than an A’-) position. Cinque furthermore makes use of the notion “subject of DP” (cf. \citealt{Cinque1980}), which can be identified, among others, by means of the following test: “the subject is the only argument of the noun which can be expressed by a possessive \isi{adjective}” (\citealt{Cinque2014}: 95, Footnote 1).\footnote{This also applies to \ili{French}. A second test for \ili{Italian} is mentioned by Cinque (ibid.): “the subject is the only argument of the noun which cannot be expressed by a 1st and 2nd pers. sing. pronoun preceded by \textit{di}”. \ili{French} is even stricter here, since it includes the third person, too. Thus: \textit{la maison *de moi / *de toi / *de lui / *d’elle / *d’eux}. I will not examine this property here, but agree with \citegen[49]{Cinque2014} idea, which roughly amounts to saying that these pronouns are incompatible with the \is{case!genitive case}genitive case because their forms are fixed for \is{case!oblique case}oblique case.}

His derivation of a DP containing a “subject” is very complex and can only be sketched here. It starts off as shown in (19) (representing the DP \textit{l’opinione di Gianni} (‘Gianni’s opinion’, lit. ‘the opinion of Gianni’), where the “subject” moves from its “thematic (Merge) position to a licensing position (Spec AgrSP or NominativeP [...])” (2014: 92):

The rest of the derivation yields the structure sketched in (20).\footnote{The three dots represent the “criterial subject position” of the DP (SubjP; cf. \citealt{Rizzi2007Properties}; \citealt{Rizzi2007Strategies}), which remains empty (containing \textit{pro}) in the case at issue and is irrelevant for our discussion.} A GP (genitive phrase) headed by the element \textit{di} is merged above AgrSP, whereas the XP remnant containing the head noun is moved to a higher specifier (cf. \citealt{Kayne1999,Kayne2004}, among others).

It is precisely the “subject” of a DP that can be extracted, for example if we use the \textit{wh} element \textit{chi} ‘who’ instead of \textit{Gianni} in (19) and (20); technically, the whole GP must be extracted in this case. \citet[94--95]{Cinque2014} explains the impossibility of extracting other arguments when the “subject” position is filled (cf. our \ili{French} cases in §2) in terms of relativized minimality (\citealt{Rizzi1990,Rizzi2001,Rizzi2004}): the external specifier of DP is an A-position in \ili{Italian} and other \ili{Romance} languages, essentially because “if it were an A’-position, we would expect any argument or \isi{adjunct} to be able to move into it” (2014: 91).\footnote{For further evidence with respect to the properties of [spec,DP] as an A-position, see \citet[87--91]{Cinque2014}.} Although this is not very clear in the article, what is meant here is that a non-“subject” argument would have to move out of the NP in the situation in (19), thus crossing the subject in Spec-AgrSP, an A-position. Since the ultimate goal of the constituent is [spec,DP], which is an A-position, too, this movement is barred by relativized minimality.

Note that Cinque’s idea concerning the A-status of [spec,DP] is similar to Gutiérrez-Bravo’s assumption. Although Gutiérrez-Bravo assumes that [spec,\linebreak DP] has a mixed A and A’ status, the primary trigger of movement is the \is{case!case feature}case feature, while the operator feature (e.g. [\textit{wh}]) is checked as a “free rider”. With respect to the issue of why a PP can have case, the advantage of Cinque’s approach is that the relevant types of N arguments are not PPs but DPs, and the element \textit{di} or \ili{French} \textit{de} is a genitive head.\footnote{Note by the way that Cinque arrives at conclusions very similar to those of \citet{Kolliakou1999} sketched in §2: “The ungrammaticality (or marginal status) of two \textit{di}{}-phrases with derived nominals based on transitive verbs (*[\textit{la distruzione} [\textit{del ponte}] [\textit{dei nemici}]] ‘the destruction of the bridge of the enemies’/[*\textit{la distruzione} [\textit{dei nemici}] [\textit{del ponte}]] ‘the destruction of the enemies of the bridge’, as opposed to [\textit{la distruzione} [\textit{del ponte}] [\textit{da parte dei nemici}]] ‘the destruction of the bridge by the enemies’) [...] may suggest that, in the \ili{Italian} DP, only one \textit{di} is available to license genitive Case [...]. Where two \textit{di}-forms appear to be (marginally) possible ([\textit{l’organizzazione} [\textit{della mostra}] [\textit{di Gianni}]] ‘the organization of the exhibition of G.’), the subject \textit{di Gianni} might in fact be a reduced relative clause ([\textit{l’organizzazione} [\textit{della mostra}] [(\textit{che era}) \textit{di Gianni}]] ‘the organization of the exhibition which was by Gianni’.” For \ili{French}, similar speaker judgments apply; i.e. \textit{Le portrait d’Aristote de Rembrandt} is more marginal than \textit{Le portrait d’Aristote par Rembrandt}.} Within the \isi{Minimalist} Program, it remains to be seen, however, how the A or A’ status of a projection should be encoded, an issue to which I will return in §4.

Cinque’s article contains some other interesting aspects, e.g. his criticism of those explanations that involve a thematic hierarchy (cf. §2):

\begin{quote}\relax [...] this is true only inasmuch as thematic roles enter into the determination of what eventually counts as the syntactic subject. When divorced from the notion of subject the thematic hierarchy fails to predict what can be extracted and what cannot. Not all Agents/Experiencers can extract in the absence of Possessors (e.g. those introduced by a \textit{by} phrase). Not all Themes can extract in the absence of Agents/Experiencers and Possessors (e.g. the Theme of Ns like \textit{desiderio} ‘desire’; cf. Cinque 1980, p. 64; Longobardi 1991, p. 66; Kolliakou 1999, sect. 2.3). Ultimately, only what qualifies by the two diagnostics above as the \textit{syntactic} subject of the DP can extract.\\\hbox{}\hfill{\citep[95–96, Footnote 1]{Cinque2014}}\end{quote}

Note, however, that Cinque’s argumentation pushes the question back one step, because what is going to be realizable as a subject of DP may still depend on some kind of hierarchy.\footnote{Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out.}

Summarizing, both \citet{Gutiérrez-Bravo2001} and \citet{Cinque2014} consider DPs to be phases.\footnote{For further arguments for the status of DP as a phase in connection with \textit{pied-piping} in \ili{French}, see \citet{Heck2008}.} Thus, a constituent can only be extracted from the DP if it first moves to its (external) specifier. Both accounts agree on the fact that this movement step has properties of A-movement, related to case properties (the extracted constituent bears \is{case!genitive case}genitive case). We can thus observe a kind of circle in the discussion of \ili{Romance} extraction phenomena: while at the beginning of the 1980s the constituents extracted from the DP were considered to be genitives, the discussion in the course of the 1980s and 1990s turned on \is{theta-role}theta-roles rather than case, an initiative with doubtful success. More modern (minimalist) approaches based on \is{phase!phase theory}phase theory have returned to considering the relevant constituents (headed by elements such as \ili{French} \textit{de} or \ili{Italian} \textit{di}) as exponents of \is{case!genitive case}genitive case. This will be important to keep in mind for what follows.

\section{A phase- and probe-based minimalist analysis} %

\subsection{Basic outline}%4.1

In this section, I develop a phase-based account that is in conformity with the minimalist probe-and-goal framework (\citealt{Chomsky2000} et seq.). As we will see, some of the insights of the previous solutions sketched in §3 independently follow from the application of this framework. Let us begin with the illustration in (21), based on (16):

    \end{forest}
\z

The dotted curved line represents the phase boundary; i.e. the part lower than the D head is not accessible for further computation. The element that we want to extract must be raised to [spec,DP] as indicated by the arrows. The problem is now why the extraction of the \isi{adjunct} is barred while that of the complement is not, even though the \isi{adjunct} is closer to the D head.\footnote{Note that this problem could easily be resolved by assuming the right-ascending theory of \is{adjunct}adjuncts (see, e.g., \citealt{Andrews1983}) together with relativized minimality. In this article, I prefer to follow \citegen{Kayne1994} antisymmetric approach, according to which \is{adjunct}adjuncts always left-adjoin. In addition, the problem persists independently of the approach chosen, because \is{adjunct}adjuncts cannot be extracted even if there is no argument in the structure (see below). In \citegen{Cinque2014} framework, this would follow because [spec,DP] is an A-position, but note that, according to the \isi{Minimalist} Program as assumed here, the notion “A-position” is not a primitive of syntax and must be expressed through features, as will be done in what follows. As for relativized minimality, note that it is not easily compatible with a minimalist, derivational approach; see \citet{Boeckx2008,Boeckx2009} for discussion.}

  As mentioned in §1.2, and as became obvious, I hope, in §§2–3, we cannot just assume an optional edge feature (EF) on D, which could just attract any constituent needed for further computation – in (21), either the \textit{wh}{}-marked complement or the \textit{wh}{}-marked \isi{adjunct}. If we cannot use an EF, we need to assume an [EPP]-feature that is connected to a probe. One necessary condition for the probe (following the framework adopted in §1.2) is that it contains an unvalued operator feature (uOp). Let us provisionally assume (22), a probe that is sensitive to interrogative, relative and focalized elements, which I argue bears [vOp] (see §1.2 above),\footnote{In addition, the extractable item must have another \is{feature!unvalued feature}unvalued feature [uF] (not corresponding to the \is{case!case feature}case feature discussed in §4.2), which is valued by the probe of the final landing site. Thus, for the cases at issue, C° will have a probe that not only contains [uOp] but is also able to value [uF] on D. This is to ensure that the \textit{wh} or relative phrase cannot remain in any of the intermediate positions ([spec,DP] or [spec,vP]), which would lead to ungrammaticality. I will not investigate the nature of this feature in the present article.} thus licensing the structures in (23):\footnote{Movement to the \is{phase!phase edge}phase edge of v is not represented in these simplified structures.}

However, the provisional formalization in (22) clearly overgenerates: a D head with this feature composition could also attract the \isi{adjunct} \textit{de qui} in the upper PP in (21) so as to yield the ungrammatical (24a) vs. the grammatical (24b). In fact, according to the descriptive generalization in (15), \is{adjunct}adjuncts can never be attracted, witness the PP indicating \SOURCE in (24c) and an \isi{adjunct} with another \isi{preposition} as in (24d):

For this reason, the feature set in (22) is not enough. Since we are looking for features that can act as a probe for detecting only arguments, an obvious solution is \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features. Recall that, according to \citet{Chomsky2000}, subjects of sentences are the goals of a phi-probe in T, whereas direct objects are the goals of a phi-probe in v. If we can generalize from this, arguments are typically the goals of a phi probe. Let us therefore modify (22) by assuming that the D head has a complex probe consisting of the unvalued operator features plus unvalued \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features. The refined version of (22) is given in (25):

\ea%25
    \label{ex:mensch:25}
    Features of D (provisional formalization II)\\
    \begin{tabbing} [uOp]\hspace{1em}\= Lorem Ipsum\kill

    \end{tabbing}
\z

Although this cannot be the final version, as we will see in §§4.2–4.3, this formalization has the advantage of coinciding with \citegen{Gutiérrez-Bravo2001} hypothesis that [spec,DP] is a hybrid A/A’-position. This is so because the [EPP]-feature is linked to a complex probe that contains an operator feature (held responsible for A’-movement) and \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features (related to A-movement).\footnote{Note that the lexical entry of a D head in (25), as well as the further elaboration in what follows (in particular on genitives with \textit{de}), is language-specific. Hence, other languages may show a behavior different from \ili{French}. See, e.g., \ili{English} \textit{Who have you seen a picture of} or even \textit{?What did you read books about?}}

\subsection{The argumental status of extractable PPs and the case problem}% 4.2 

Unfortunately (25) does not yet bring the desired result, since, as in (24a), the \isi{adjunct} \textit{de qui} must also be argued to contain \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features. An even clearer example is the relative pronoun \textit{lequel}, which is inflected for gender and number, but is still ungrammatical when it forms part of an \isi{adjunct} PP extracted from a DP, while it is grammatical if it is part of an argumental PP. In order to further refine the formalization in (25), some more considerations, in particular concerning the status of the \isi{preposition} \textit{de}, are in order, along the following lines: crucially for my analysis, in the case of subjects and direct objects, it is the unvalued \is{case!case feature}case feature that makes the goal visible to the probe \citep[123]{Chomsky2000}.\footnote{As an anonymous reviewer points out, late-adjunction approaches would also predict that \is{adjunct}adjuncts cannot be found by the probe, because when \isi{Agree} takes place the \isi{adjunct} is simply not yet present.} This leads me to assume that those expressions in \ili{French} containing the element \textit{de} that can be extracted from a DP are themselves DPs (containing an unvalued \is{case!case feature}case feature), and not PPs, so the element \textit{de} is not a \isi{preposition} but a kind of \is{case!genitive case}genitive case marker. Note that the idea that the expressions under discussion here are genitives coincides with the conclusions reached by \citet{Gutiérrez-Bravo2001} and \citet{Cinque2014} for independent reasons and in other frameworks (see §3). However, it is a natural outcome of my attempt to apply a minimalist approach of the kind proposed in \citeauthor{Chomsky2000} (\citeyear{Chomsky2000} et seq.).

To treat arguments of N that contain \textit{de} or analogous elements in other \ili{Romance} languages (such as \ili{Italian} \textit{di}) as genitives is an old idea formulated as early as \citet{Benveniste1966}, and later implemented in various ways in generative grammar. We have already seen one possibility in §3: the G[enitive]P assumed by \citet{Cinque2014}. This is not, however, appropriate in the framework adopted here, in which \is{case!case feature}case features are valued later by a higher probe. A more neutral label is K[ase]P (cf. \citealt{Bittner1996}; \citealt{Neeleman1999}, among many others), although such a label should in fact be avoided, as it does not have semantic content (cf. \citealt{Chomsky1995}). In my view, it would be preferable to assume that the element \textit{de} is inserted post-syntactically, just like synthetic case morphology (see, e.g., \citealt{Marchis2018}). I cannot discuss this any further here and remain rather theory-neutral with respect to the status of \ili{Romance} analytical genitives. I provisionally use the term KP, following \citet[23]{Biggs2014}, in that KP is “primarily employed as a placeholder for (late) morpho-phonological insertion.” I will not be concerned with the internal structure of KPs, on which various views exist, so I will label the whole expression as KP.

Let us then assume that arguments of N that represent \AGENT, \THEME or \POSSESSOR\footnote{To these we may possibly add “partitive” complements of nouns designating a quantity (such as \textit{moitié} ‘half’, \textit{plupart} ‘majority’, \textit{litre} ‘liter’, \textit{kilo} ‘kilo’ etc.), cf. \citet[236–237]{Godard1992}; \citet{Doetjes1997}.} are KPs, where KP has valued \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features plus an unvalued \is{case!case feature}case feature. I furthermore assume that the D-head assigns \is{case!genitive case}genitive case under \isi{Agree} (cf. \citealt{Radford2004}: 368–369; \citealt{Rappaport2006}, among others), which I formalize with a valued \is{case!case feature}case feature on D.\footnote{Since the whole DP itself has a \is{case!case feature}case feature that is valued by a higher functional head, this is a complex issue (cf. \citealt{Weisser2012}). Also see Footnote 22.} For a case without extraction, such as \textit{le livre de Jean}, lit. ‘the book of Jean’, this can be illustrated as follows:

\ea%26

\end{scope}
\end{forest}
\z



The unvalued \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features of D act as a probe and find the valued \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features of the KP, triggering \isi{Agree} and valuing the KP’s [uCase] as [Gen], which is spelled out as \textit{de} on the K head. Intervening \is{adjunct}adjuncts do not have an unvalued \is{case!case feature}case feature and will not be seen by the probe. The D head has no intrinsic [EPP]-feature in \ili{French}, so the KP is not attracted to [spec,DP] in (26). A \isi{determiner} with this feature composition is thus not apt for our extraction cases, which is the desired result, since only a subset of KPs, namely those containing an additional valued operator feature, can be extracted (recall my provisional formalization in (25)). Thus, if something needs to be extracted (ultimately because C has an unvalued operator feature), the \isi{determiner} must be merged with the special feature composition shown in the (still provisional) formalization in (27) (revised from (25)): 

\begin{exe}\ex%27
    \label{ex:mensch:27}
        \interlinepenalty10000 Features of D (provisional formalization II)\\

            ]
        ]
    ]
\end{forest}
    \end{exe}



Although this feature composition of the D head responsible for extraction makes the right predictions, it is still incomplete. The reason is that the head noun also has \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features, and possibly even an unvalued \is{case!case feature}case feature, which must be valued by a head outside the DP (e.g. with [Nom] or [Acc]). This problem will be addressed in the next subsection. 

\subsection{The feature composition of French determiners}% 4.3  

Thus far in §4, I have been concerned with determining the features that must be assumed for the D head in its functions as a genitive assigner and as a \is{phase!phase head}phase head that can permit, in some special cases, the extraction of DP-internal material to its specifier in order to license further extraction. But, of course, the D head has another, more obvious property, namely agreement with the head noun. Thus, crucially, in an expression like \textit{la maison de Pierre} (the.\textsc{fsg} house.\textsc{f.sg} of Pierre.\textsc{m.sg}) the \isi{determiner} (\textit{la}) agrees in gender with the head noun \textit{maison} and not with the KP \textit{de Pierre}. This seems to cast serious doubt on the probe approach that I have just developed. The solution that I will adopt is that \ili{French} \is{determiner}determiners actually have two phi-sets, corresponding to two probes. Thus, \ili{French} articles have the following basic feature composition:

\ea%28
    \label{ex:mensch:28}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{rl@{}l}
     & [uφ\textsubscript{1}] & \\
     \ldelim({2}{0mm} & [uφ\textsubscript{2}] & \rdelim){2}{0mm}\\
     & [vCase] (Gen) & \\
    \end{tabular}
\z

This is an instance of multiple probes (cf. \citealt{Chomsky2008}), and, more particularly, of feature-stacking (see \citealt{Manetta2011}: Chapter 2 for discussion and literature). In our case, this means that the two probes are ordered, with [u$\varphi $\textsubscript{1}] having to probe first (finding the head noun as its goal) and [u$\varphi $\textsubscript{2}] second (finding the KP). The bracket around the second probe indicates that it is optional (i.e. it must enter the derivation only if a KP with an unvalued \is{case!case feature}case feature is present). The fact that multiple phi-sets can exist on D-heads can be seen in \ili{French} possessives, as shown in (29):

\ea%29
    \label{ex:mensch:29}
    \gll   son    livre   \hspace{1.5em} ma  veste  \hspace{1.5em}  tes    livres\\
           his/her.\textsc{m}  book.\textsc{m} {} my.\textsc{f}  jacket.\textsc{f} {} your.\textsc{sg-pl}  books.\textsc{pl}\\
\z

The morphemes \{s-\}, \{m-\}, \{t-\} represent the \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features (3rd sg., 1st sg., 2nd sg.) of the possessor, whereas the morphemes \{-on\}, \{-a\}, \{-es\} reflect those of the head noun. I actually assume that the complex possessive forms in (29) are the spell-out of D heads with a very similar feature composition to that in (28). Let us assume that the expressions in (29) are DPs that contain a phonologically empty KP (something like a covert pronominal). Since articles combine with referring expressions whereas pronominals do not, the difference between articles and possessives can be modeled by a further feature that I provisionally identify as [+/- ref(erential)]:\footnote{I do not address the issue of external \is{case!case assignment}case assignment to the DP. As an anonymous reviewer points out, D heads also need [uCase], which is valued by a probe from outside the DP (e.g. the probe contained in v), and then probably passed to the N head (\isi{concord}).}

We can now return to the problem of extraction and proceed to the final revision of the formalization initiated in (22) and further refined in (25) and (27): the D head needed for the extraction cases at issue here is a variant of (30a), enriched with the [uOp] feature and the [EPP]-feature connected to it (cf. (27) above). We can integrate this as a further optional part of (30a) so as to yield (31):

This complex entry reads as follows: minimally, a \ili{French} article (or a demonstrative) has one unvalued phi-set which probes the head noun and determines the morphology of the \isi{determiner}. Optionally, there can be an additional probe with a (genitive-)case-assigning property. This option is needed when the head noun has a KP complement and can be enriched by an unvalued operator feature connected to an [EPP]-feature if the KP needs to be extracted.

\section{Conclusions}% 5. 

In this article, I have focused on the extraction of PPs from DPs (in \textit{wh}, relative and focus contexts), which is sometimes permitted but at other times leads to ungrammaticality. The main aim of this article has been to determine the conditions that allow/disallow extraction, on which there has been controversy in the literature, and to develop a phase-based account within Chomsky’s (\citeyear{Chomsky2000} et seq.) probe-and-goal framework. I have concentrated on \ili{French}, although the data are similar in other \ili{Romance} languages.

On a purely descriptive level, it appears that a subset of PPs headed by the \isi{preposition} \textit{de}, in which the PP represents an \AGENT, \THEME or \POSSESSOR, is extractable. Other instances of [\textsubscript{PP} \textit{de} ...] (e.g. PPs indicating source/origin or – following \citealt{Kolliakou1999} – PPs that are property-denoting expressions and have a similar function to \is{adjective}adjectives), as well as PPs with \is{preposition}prepositions other than \textit{de}, cannot be extracted from the DP, thus yielding a kind of “island effect”. Still at a descriptive level, this can be generalized by assuming that only PPs with \textit{de} that represent an \AGENT, \THEME or \POSSESSOR are complements, while all other PPs are \is{adjunct}adjuncts, and that \is{adjunct}adjuncts are not extractable from DPs. A major issue that is discussed in the literature is the presence, in a single structure, of two or more PPs that fit the relevant extraction criteria. I have followed \citegen{Kolliakou1999} argument that, in such cases, only one of them can be an argument, whereas the others are \is{adjunct}adjuncts (property-denoting expressions).

The relevant subset of PPs introduced by \textit{de} has sometimes been informally classified as “genitives” in the literature, but in the 1980s and 1990s, the discussion mostly turned on \is{theta-role}theta-roles, trying to predict the extraction of PPs from DPs in terms of a thematic hierarchy. By contrast, two minimalist accounts that I have summarized in §3 (\citealt{Gutiérrez-Bravo2001}; \citealt{Cinque2014}) assume that extractable PPs headed by \textit{de} or equivalent \is{preposition}prepositions in other \ili{Romance} languages represent \is{case!genitive case}genitive case in the technical sense. However, these accounts assume agreement phrases, which are not compatible with more recent minimalist literature. Both accounts are nevertheless formulated within \is{phase!phase theory}phase theory, an idea that logically continues the view formulated by \citet{Cinque1980}, according to which extraction from DP (NP in \citealt{Cinque1980}) to a higher category (usually CP) necessarily passes through [spec, DP] (formerly [spec,NP]). 

In §4, I applied Chomsky’s \isi{probe-goal} approach in order to explain extraction of a PP to the DP \is{phase!phase edge}phase edge. Essentially, what we need to assume is that D° can have an unvalued operator feature ([uOp]) bound to an [EPP]-feature. The operator feature alone, however, does not qualify as a probe capable of explaining the data, since it would match any constituent containing [vOp], crucially including \is{adjunct}adjuncts. There must therefore be an additional feature on the goal that guarantees the visibility of arguments (but not of \is{adjunct}adjuncts) to the probe. Following the logic of the \isi{probe-goal} approach, this should be an unvalued \is{case!case feature}case feature, a solution that lends further support to the genitive hypothesis. Since case belongs to the agreement system, the data must be explained by a complex probe on the D head, which contains unvalued \is{feature!phi-feature}phi-features in addition to [uOp]. I then argued that \ili{Romance} articles can optionally have this complex probe, in addition to their “regular” unvalued phi-set (which regulates agreement between the article and the head noun). Thus, if something needs to be extracted from a DP, the D head has two phi-sets. Note that the extracted constituent must be classified as a DP or a KP rather than a PP.

\ili{French} possessives, another type of \isi{determiner}, can also be argued to have two phi-sets (in this case both are morphologically visible). This is encoded in the lexical entries of possessives, which do not have [uOp] and lack an [EPP]-feature. Interestingly, the fact that possessives and articles compete for the D° position then explains the incompatibility of extraction with the presence of possessives, which has been observed in the literature (cf. \citealt{Milner1978,Milner1982}; quoted in \citealt{Sag1994}):

    \glt ‘the Ninth (symphony), of which I have much loved his interpretation’  }
    \z

The theory sketched here also explains complex DP islands. In an example such as (1a), the special complex probe in the D head needs to identify a constituent with an unvalued \is{case!case feature}case feature as its goal in order to attract it to the DP \is{phase!phase edge}phase edge. However, the \is{case!case feature}case feature of the putative goal, \textit{qui} in the relative clause, is already valued as accusative in the relative clause.

A final note concerns the assumption that constituents introduced by \is{preposition}prepositions other than \textit{de} are \is{adjunct}adjuncts, which is assumed in most of the literature and which I have adopted as a working hypothesis during the whole article. My final approach makes this assumption unnecessary, since such constituents would be PPs and not KPs.

On a more general theoretical level, the study of the phenomena at issue here shows that not all intermediate movement steps can be explained by \citegen{Chomsky2008} edge features (EFs). EFs are designed to optionally apply whenever needed, but they are not capable of selecting specific goals. Whereas we can assume an EF on v for ensuring cyclic movement from the DP edge to the CP, we cannot do so for the movement to the DP edge itself.
