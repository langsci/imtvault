\title{A person split analysis of the progressive forms in Barese}

\abstract{This paper explores the distribution of progressive aspect in some varieties of the \ili{Barese} (dialect of \il{Apulian}Apulia). In many of these varieties the progressive is expressed through an aspectual inflected construction (in the terms of \citealt{Manzini2005}): it is formed from an inflected stative verb stɛ (=‘to stay’), a connecting element a (=‘to’) and the present indicative of the lexical verb, which agrees in person and number with the matrix verb. The multiple agreement configuration, as in pseudo{}-coordinations (\citealt{Jaeggli1993}) is not interpreted as a coordination of two events occurring at the same time, but as a single complex event, with V1 having scope over V2, an interpretation that is usually realized with a non-finite form of V2 to represent an aspectual semantic value. In the same variety, however, we can find a parallel construction to express the progressive in which the embedded lexical verb is not inflected. The 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural are not found in the aspectual inflected constructions, but allow only the infinitival counterpart.

\section{The progressive inflected and non-inflected constructions in Barese}% 1. 

In some varieties of \ili{Barese}, the progressive is expressed through an aspectual inflected construction (in the terms of \citealt{Manzini2005}): an inflected \isi{stative} verb \textit{stɛ} (=‘to stay’), a connecting element \textit{a} (=‘to’) and the present indicative of the lexical verb, which agrees in person and number with the matrix verb. This progressive construction contains a \is{agreement!multiple agreement}multiple agreement configuration involving an inflected auxiliary and a finite complement introduced by \textit{a}, as in finite control constructions of the Balkan type.\footnote{The phenomenon of finite control in the Balkan languages (and in Hebrew and many Southern \ili{Italian} varieties) involves the appearance of inflected \isi{subjunctive} complements which exhibit Obligatory Control (\citealt{Landau2004}, among others): finite complements in these languages cover pretty much the entire spectrum of obligatory control or raising predicates (for an overview, see \citealt{Ledgeway2015,Manzini2017}). The verbs embedding \textit{a} complements, such as the ones we are describing, are a much more restricted set than the obligatory control\slash raising verbs in Balkan languages. The Apulian varieties under analysis, for example, include ‘go’ and ‘be\slash stay’ aspectual periphrases; we will concentrate on the ‘stay’ periphrases (for an analysis of the differences in aspectual finite constructions across southern \ili{Italian} varieties, see \citealt{Manzini2017}).}  The example in (1) shows the progressive aspectual construction in the variety spoken in \il{Conversanese}Conversano (Apulia): 

\ea%1
    \label{ex:lorusso:1}
    \gll Stek    a   fatsə    u    pɛn.     \\
         stay.\textsc{1sg}   to  do.\textsc{1sg} the    bread\\
    \glt ‘I am making the bread.’
    \z


In the same variety, we can find a parallel construction to express the progressive in which the embedded lexical verb is not inflected. In (2), the embedded verb \textit{fɛ} ('to do') is infinitival: 

\ea%2
    \label{ex:lorusso:2}
    \gll Stek     a  fɛ     u    pɛn.      \\
         stay.\textsc{1sg} to   do.\textsc{inf}    the    bread\\
    \glt ‘I am making the bread.’
    \z

In \ili{Conversanese}, the aspectual inflected construction is not found with the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural, as shown in (3): only the construction with an embedded infinitival lexical verb is available to express the progressive, as in (4):\footnote{Similar patterns are found in the varieties from the same area (i.e. in the south-east of Bari, in A: Mola di Bari, Rutigliano, Castellana, Turi). Throughout the paper we will refer mainly to the variety of \il{Conversanese}Conversano, but we will also sketch some relevant differences between the variety of \il{Conversanese}Conversano and some other varieties of the same group in §2.}\largerpage[-4]

Both types of structure share a \isi{locative} derivation: the majority of progressive forms crosslinguistically, in fact, are derived from expressions involving \isi{locative} elements  \citep{Bybee1994,Mateu1999,Laka2006}. The two parallel constructions differ in the aspect of the denoted event. On the one hand, the construction with the embedded inflected verb, (1), denotes an \is{Event Identification}event identification between the auxiliary and the lexical verb and seems to work like a restructuring or serial verb construction. On the other hand, the construction with the embedded \isi{infinitive}, (2), involves a \isi{frequentative} reading which is not found with genuine progressive constructions \citep{Chierchia1995} and seems to pattern with aspectual control verbs. The 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural are not found in the aspectual inflected construction in (3), but allow only the infinitival counterpart (4). Differences in the pattern of the morphological derivation of the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural is quite common across \ili{Romance} languages \citep{Manzini2005,Manzini2011Bio}: they involve, in fact, a more complex referentiality than other persons \citep{Bobaljik2008Missing}; they are not mere plurals of the discourse participants, but may refer to other referents not directly involved in the discourse (event participants). In a lexical parametrization analysis \citep{Manzini2011Bio}, languages involve a parametric distinction for plural and singular: plural persons do not show a pattern of parametric distinction between discourse (1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd}) and event participants (3\textsuperscript{rd}) found with singular persons. 

In §2, the distribution of the pattern of inflection across the different varieties is described: the insights of previous accounts are also listed. §3 introduces the analysis of the progressive as a \isi{locative}\slash \isi{unaccusative} construction (in the terms of \citealt{Mateu1999}). §4 presents a syntactic analysis of the phenomenon. In §5, the aspectual differences between the two progressive patterns are described. §6 is devoted to some reflections on the \isi{person split} pattern found in the progressive constructions in \ili{Conversanese}. §7 resumes the insight and the main concerns of the present analysis. 

\section{The distribution of aspectual inflected constructions}% 2. 
\subsection{Introduction}% 2.1. 

Various studies have focused on periphrastic verbal constructions in some Southern \ili{Italian} varieties that involve two inflected verbs.\footnote{As suggested by an anonymous reviewer, this construction apparently shares the derivation of hyper-raising constructions \citep{Harford1985,Martins2005,Nunes2008,Zeller2006}, but there are few elements that allow us to take them as non- hyper raising constructions. In this paper we are dealing mainly with the auxiliary \textit{stare} (=‘stay’) in the progressive constructions, which is not a raising predicate. Furthermore, in many Southern \ili{Italian} varieties these constructions are also found with motion verbs (\textit{go}, \textit{come}) or modal auxiliaries (\textit{want}) (\citealt{Manzini2005,Di2015,Manzini2017,CardinalettiND}), but no genuine raising predicate is involved. The subject is base-generated (and case-assigned) under the T of the matrix verb. One more contrast with hyper-raising constructions is that no expletive counterpart of the sentences is available in the languages under analysis (or any version with embedded subjects). These constructions share more similarities with finite control constructions found in Balkan languages \citep{Landau2004,Landau2013,Manzini2000} and in Southern \ili{Italian} varieties \citep{Manzini2005,Ledgeway2015}.}  The main characteristic of these constructions is that a matrix aspectual auxiliary inflected for number and person selects a lexical verb that is also inflected. The lexical embedded verb may or may not be introduced by a \isi{preposition}. The auxiliary loses its lexical meaning and the complex VP is interpreted as a single predicate, the embedded lexical verb being the one that gives the referential meaning to the event denoted by the complex VP. For example, in (5) the subject \textit{Ma'ri} is not ‘staying’ and then eating, but just eating:

\ea%5
         \il{Conversanese}Conversano, Apulia\label{ex:lorusso:5}\\
    \gll Ma'ri  ste     a   manʤɜ.\\
         Maria  stay.\textsc{3sg}  to  eat.\textsc{3sg}\\
    \glt ‘Maria is eating.’
    \z          

Similar patterns are found in different Southern \ili{Italian} varieties. \citet{Ledgeway1997} refers to imperative structures in \ili{Neapolitan} that involve two inflected verbs as asyndetic constructions. A fully inflected verb is embedded under another fully inflected matrix verb, as in (6). There is no \isi{preposition} introducing the embedded element. In his terms, these constructions define a family of coordinative constructions grammaticalized into subordination. These imperative constructions are paratactic in the sense that “..they contain as many assertions as there are clauses […]” \citep[231]{Ledgeway1997}; in (6), in fact, there are two assertions (7), whereas the progressive construction in \ili{Conversanese} contains only one assertion ranging over the entire construction.

\ea%6
    \label{ex:lorusso:6}
    \gll Va     spanne     'epanne  nfuse.\\
         go.\textsc{imp.2sg} hang.out.\textsc{imp.2sg}  the.clothes  wet\\
    \glt ‘Go and hang out the washing.’ \citep[230]{Ledgeway1997}
    \z

\ea%7
    \label{ex:lorusso:7}
    \ea   Va!\\
    \glt  ‘Go!’
    \ex   Spanne epanne nfuse!\\
    \glt  ‘Hang out the washing!’ \citep[231]{Ledgeway1997}
    \z
\z

Most \ili{Sicilian} dialects make use of a construction with a functional verb (usually of motion), followed by the linking element \textit{a} and an inflected verb. \citet{Cardinaletti2001,Cardinaletti2003} label these structures Inflected Constructions.\footnote{In the terms of \citet{Cruschina2013}, these are Doubly Inflected Constructions.} They are “..similar to what is generally known as ``Serial Verb Construction'' in other language families (cf. \citealt{Aikhenvald2006}), in which the two verbs (V1 and V2) share the same inflection for Tense and person […]” \citep[392]{Di2015}. The examples in (8) from the dialect spoken in Delia (Caltanissetta) are considered by \citet{Di2015} as monoclausal constructions with a functional verb, in opposition to their infinitival counterparts (9), which are the only option in standard \ili{Italian} (10) and are biclausal constructions:

\ea%8
    \label{ex:lorusso:8}
    \gll La  sira    mi    veni    a  ccunta    du   cosi.\\
         the  evening  to.me\textsc{(cl)}  come.\textsc{3sg}  to tell.\textsc{3sg} two  things\\
    \glt ‘He comes to tell me some stories at night.’
    \z


\ea%9
    \label{ex:lorusso:9}
    \gll La  sira    mi    veni     a  ccuntari  du   cosi. \\
         the  evening  to.me\textsc{(cl)}  come.\textsc{3sg}  to  tell.\textsc{inf} two  things\\
    \z



\ea%10
    \label{ex:lorusso:10}
    \gll La  sera    mi    viene     a   raccontare / *racconta  delle  storie.\\
         the  evening  to.me\textsc{(cl)} come.\textsc{3sg}  to  tell.\textsc{inf} / tell.\textsc{3sg}  some  stories\\
    \glt ‘He comes to tell me some stories at night.’ \citep{Di2015}
    \z


In the present analysis, both the inflected and the infinitival constructions will be analyzed, following the intuition of \citet[1:688]{Manzini2005}, as biclausal structures: while the inflected construction involves \is{Event Identification}event identification (§3 and §4), the infinitival counterparts do not. The differences in the aspectual reading (see §4) of the two types of progressive construction in \ili{Conversanese} will confirm this analysis.

\citet[I:688--689]{Manzini2005} propose an \is{Event Identification}event identification analysis for all the aspectual constructions with finite verbs found in \ili{Apulian}, \ili{Calabrian} and \ili{Sicilian} varieties. These aspectual constructions are found with different matrix verbs: progressive (\textit{stay}) in (11), motion verbs (\textit{go}, \textit{come}) in (12), and modals (\textit{want}, \textit{will}, \textit{must}) in (13).

In the present work we will be dealing mainly with the progressive constructions involving the auxiliary \textit{stay}, but the assumptions of the present analysis can also be applied to the other aspectual constructions with inflected verbs.

\subsection{The progressive aspectual consructions with finite verbs in the Apulian varieties}% 2.2. 

In the Southern \ili{Apulian} variety of \il{Conversanese}Conversano, the present continuous progressive is expressed through an aspectual inflected construction involving the inflected \isi{stative} verb \textit{stɛ} (=‘to stay’), a connecting element \textit{a} (=‘to’) and the present indicative of the lexical verb, which agrees in person and number with the matrix verb. In \tabref{tab:lorusso:1}, the paradigm of inflection for the present indicative is presented. The same pattern of inflection is not found in past tenses or the imperative. The inflection is also not found on embedded verbs in the case of the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural.\footnote{Other varieties have the very same paradigm with respect to the lack of an aspectual \isi{infinitive} construction for the 1st and 2nd persons plural and with past tenses and imperatives: the varieties of Castellana, Turi, Rutigliano, Mola and Poligano. These towns are also in the south-eastern part of Bari.}

In the same area, there are varieties, such as those of Putignano (\tabref{tab:lorusso:2}) and Martina Franca (\tabref{tab:lorusso:3}) \citep[I:689–690]{Manzini2005}, where specialized forms are found in the inflection for the auxiliary \textit{stay} (\textsc{2sg, 3sg, 1pl, 2pl}), which differs from the inflected forms of the lexical verb \textit{stay}. With 1\textsuperscript{st} \textsc{sg} and 3\textsuperscript{rd} \textsc{pl} the inflected forms of the auxiliary coincide with those of the lexical counterpart \textit{stay}.

In both the variety of Putignano and that of Martina Franca (Tables 2 and 3), when the forms of the auxiliary coincide with the forms of the lexical \textit{stay}, the embedded predicate is introduced by the \isi{preposition} \textit{a} (see 1\textsuperscript{st} \textsc{sg} and 3\textsuperscript{rd} plural for Putignano and 3\textsuperscript{rd} plural for Martina Franca). Along this line of analysis, there is the variety of Mesagne where the auxiliary ‘stay’ shares only its root with the lexical \textit{stay}: a specialized inflection is found in the progressive construction which is different from the lexical use of the verb (\tabref{tab:lorusso:3}), as noted by \citet[I:691]{Manzini2005}. Since the auxiliary has specialized forms, there is no \isi{preposition} introducing the embedded verbs.

Apparently, in all the varieties in which there are specialized forms for the aspectual auxiliary, we do not find any restriction on the inflection of the embedded verb. So while in \ili{Conversanese} (\tabref{tab:lorusso:1}) there are no specialized forms for the auxiliary, and with 1\textsuperscript{st} pl and 2\textsuperscript{nd} pl we do not find the full inflected embedded verb, in the other varieties, when the aspectual auxiliary has specialized forms, the embedded verb is always inflected. While this generalization seems to hold for the \ili{Apulian} varieties under analysis (Tables 1–3), it is not attested in all varieties (including those from Sicily, Calabria and Salento) described by \citet{Manzini2017}. Following these authors, we assume that different micro{}-parameters cluster together across varieties, such as the presence\slash absence of the \isi{preposition} \textit{a} and the inflectional morphology on the specialized forms of the auxiliary. In the majority of varieties, Manzini et al. found that only one verb shows the complete inflectional paradigm, either the auxiliary or the embedded verb; a huge number of dialects have inflections on the embedded verb – with the possibility of partial phi{}-feature inflection on the matrix verb (as in the reduced forms of the specialized auxiliary in the cases of Putignano in \tabref{tab:lorusso:2} and Martina Franca in \tabref{tab:lorusso:3}). Thus, the parametric variation seems to be linked mainly to where the inflection appears: on the auxiliary, on the embedded verb or on both. \footnote{Following the data of \citet{Manzini2017}, we can find only two varieties in which both the matrix auxiliary and the embedded verb show the full inflectional paradigm (with no specialized forms for the auxiliary): the \ili{Apulian} variety of Torre S. Susanna and the Sicilian variety of Modica. Nevertheless, there is a single example of the matrix verb bearing the full inflectional specifications to the exclusion of the embedded verb, namely Carmiano (\il{Apulian}Apulia). For a detailed analysis of the micro-parametric variation in aspectual inflected constructions, see \citet{Manzini2017}.} 

In many varieties, \citet{Manzini2017} do not find a 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} person plural split for finite\slash non-finite embedding; rather, the splits involve different persons or the number feature alone (singular vs. plural).\footnote{In the variety of Camporeale (\citealt[38]{Manzini2017}).} With regard to our data, the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} person plural split found in the distribution of the progressive aspectual inflected construction in \ili{Conversanese} is linked to a general pattern found across \ili{Romance} varieties, according to which 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural show different inflectional patterns (\citealt{Manzini2005,Manzini2007,Manzini2011Bio}) because they are more referentially complex; we will return to this topic in §6. 

In sum, this general pattern of aspectual inflection is quite widespread in the Southern varieties. These constructions may vary in the aspectual auxiliary that participates in these derivations (progressive, modal, motion verb) and in the tense (present, past) and mood (imperative, indicative) in which they are found. Furthermore, the appearance of agreement morphology on V1 and V2 is subject to microparametric variation. Within the spectrum of variation, some varieties, such as that of \il{Conversanese}Conversano, show a \isi{person split}person split for 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural, for which the inflected construction is not available. However, all these progressive aspectual inflected constructions share \isi{locative} properties (for example, the second verb introduced by the \isi{preposition} \textit{a}). In the next section, a crosslinguistic analysis of the locative-like system of the progressive will be presented in order to provide a background for the syntactic proposal in §4.

\section{The progressives as locative unaccusative constructions}% 3.
In the typological literature, progressives have been claimed to involve \isi{locative} constructions. This fits with a very widespread characteristic of human language: progressive is often realized in syntax in the form of a \isi{locative} predication. The pervasiveness of this grammatical isomorphism between progressive and spatial location was clearly documented in the typological overview undertaken by \citet{Bybee1994}. The progressive involving a \isi{locative} construction can be distinguished in terms of how the \isi{locative} relation is expressed: either by a \isi{preposition} or an auxiliary.

Languages like \ili{Italian} and \ili{Spanish} may encode the progressive through the use of the auxiliary ‘stay’: \textit{stare} (in \ili{Italian}) in (14) and \textit{estar} in \ili{Spanish} (15). The same auxiliary is found with \isi{locative} expressions and with stage-level predicates, as in the \ili{Spanish} examples (16) and (17).

\citet{Mateu1999}, among others, show that in a wide range of languages progressives are also expressed through the use of \isi{locative} \is{preposition}prepositions. Examples (18-20) show that progressives are expressed through an overt \isi{locative} \isi{preposition} in \ili{Dutch} (18) and \ili{French} (19), while Middle \ili{English} expressed the progressive through the \isi{preposition} \textit{on} (20).

In languages like \ili{Gungbe}, there is a progressive particle \textit{tò} which means literally ‘be at’. The lexical verb, when it immediately follows the progressive particle, similarly to what happens in \ili{Conversanese}, may undergo a process of reduplication \citep{Aboh2004,Aboh2009}, as in (21), where \textit{ɖa} is the verb and \textit{ɖiɖa} is its reduplicated form.

\citet{Mateu1999}, referring to this general analysis of progressives as \isi{locative} constructions, further argue that progressives are universally \isi{unaccusative}. In their proposal, two assumptions are made in order to refer to progressives as \is{unaccusative}unaccusatives: the first is that, since progressives are expressed in the majority of the languages in the world by a \isi{locative} structure, \is{locative}locatives are \is{unaccusative}unaccusatives, and so progressive represents a process of unaccusativization for the lexical verbs that enter into the progressive derivation. This unaccusativization does not involve a change in the argument structure of the embedded verb. The thematic roles are assigned by the embedded verb that is selected in the \isi{locative} construction. This kind of change is a type-changing operation (\citealt{deSwart1998}; \citealt{Fernald1999}): the event expressed by the embedded verb becomes a state through the \isi{locative} construction involving the auxiliary and\slash or the \isi{locative} \isi{preposition}.\footnote{In this respect, \citet{Manzini2017} do not use the term ``unaccusativization'' in the same way as \citet{Mateu1999}. The change in the semantics of the embedded verbs is linked to the instantiation of a part\slash whole relation between the event (denoted by the embedded predicate) and the auxiliary: the embedded predicate is the event whose internal aspect represents the \textit{whole}, while the auxiliary represents the time of utterance and it is the part of the event which is stressed by the progressive form (for a discussion of this semantic proposal, see \citealt{Higginbotham2009} and \citealt{Landman1992}). I will be using the term ``unaccusativization'' just to refer to this event type change, as was also the case in the original framework of \citet{Mateu1999}; see Footnote 9 in this respect.}  The second assumption is strictly linked to the first assumption: the process of unaccusativization is implied by the fact that the subject of a progressive structure enters in a central coincidence relation with the event denoted by the lexical verb (i.e. its lexical aspect or aktionsart). The central coincidence relation is the location within the \isi{locative} structure: it is one precise moment within the event.\footnote{\citet{Mateu1999} argues that there is a syntactically relevant semantic structure, which can be represented in a tree structure (cf . \citealt{Bouchard1995} for the same proposal). In their lexical-conceptual structure (LCS), the argument structure of the verbs (including \isi{locative} constructions) can be viewed as a spatial relation in the sense that it purely relates elements to our cognitive space: Figure (i.e. the subject) and Ground (the \isi{locative} complement), to use \citegen{Talmy1985} terminology. On this approach, the timeframe of an event is also represented through a spatial relation.}  For telic predicates, such as in (22), the event has a natural endpoint in the sense that John ‘finished’ building the house. In the progressive version (23), the subject \textit{John} is centrally located within the temporal contour of the event of building the house, so he is represented in a moment in which the the process of building is not yet complete.\footnote{For an analysis of how languages encode the central coincidence relation or terminal coincidence relation first introduced by \citet{Hale1993}, see \citet{Mateu2002} and \citet{Ramchand2001}.}

In ergative languages like \ili{Basque}, the single argument (‘subject’) of an \isi{intransitive} verb behaves like the object of a transitive verb and is marked with the \is{case!absolutive case}absolutive case, and it differs from the agent (‘subject’) of a transitive verb, which is marked with the \is{case!ergative case}ergative case. \citet{Laka2006} argues that progressive structures in \ili{Basque} are homomorphic with \isi{locative}\slash \isi{unaccusative} structures, which results from the fact that the progressive auxiliary \textit{ari} involves a biclausal syntactic structure (26). The main verb \textit{ari} ‘to be engaged’ takes a \isi{locative} PP (‘in something’) expressed through the \isi{locative} suffix, as in the \isi{intransitive} structures in (24, 26): the PP can take a nominal complement (24b) or a VP (26b).

With transitive verbs, \citet{Laka2006} points out that there is a contrast between canonical transitive sentences, in which the subject receives \is{case!ergative case}ergative case (25), and their progressive equivalents, in which the subject and the nominalized\linebreak clause \textit{ogia jaten} (26) receive \is{case!absolutive case}absolutive case (zero marked).

These data concerning overt case marking in \ili{Basque} confirm that progressive structures imply an unaccusativization of the event: when the progressive auxiliary is expressed, the subject is marked with \is{case!absolutive case}absolutive case, as in all \isi{intransitive} (\isi{unaccusative}) structures. Furthermore, the presence of a PP as a complement of the auxiliary supports the crosslinguistic generalization that progressives are \isi{unaccusative} \isi{locative} constructions. The next section is devoted to the analysis of the progressive constructions in \ili{Conversanese} as \isi{locative} constructions. 

\section{A syntactic analysis of the progressive inflected constructions}% 4. 
\subsection{Introduction}% 4.1. 
The main progressive construction in \ili{Conversanese}, which we introduced in §1 and §2 and is repeated here in (27), is formed from an inflected \isi{stative} verb \textit{stɛ} (=‘to stay’), a \isi{locative} \isi{preposition} \textit{a} and an inflected lexical verb. It patterns with the \isi{unaccusative} \isi{locative} construction (28) formed from a \isi{stative} auxiliary and a \isi{locative} phrase. 

\ea%27
    \label{ex:lorusso:27}
    \gll Stek     a  fatsə    u    pɜn.     \\

         stay.\textsc{1sg} at   home  \\
    \glt ‘I am at home.’
\z

The main difference between the two sentences is that in (28) the complement of the \isi{preposition} is an NP: the subject is in a spatial relation with the NP \textit{'k}\textit{ɜsə} (=‘home’). In (27), the subject is centrally located within the timeframe denoted by the telic event of making the bread. The progressive involves a PP that introduces an IP. We propose for (27) the derivation suggested by \citet{Manzini2005}: the aspectual inflected construction involves a connecting \isi{preposition} which is selected by the aspectual auxiliary (29).

The sentence in (29) is a biclausal structure, since both the auxiliary and the embedded verb show overt present indicative morphology. These constructions can be considered biclausal if we follow one of the diagnostics proposed to account for the biclausality of present perfect (for \ili{English}, \citealt{Chomsky1957,Chomsky1981,Chomsky1995}; for \ili{Romance} languages, \citealt{Kayne1993,Manzini2005,Manzini2007,Manzini2011Bio}): that is, the \isi{optionality} of \is{clitic!clitic placement}clitic placement in \ili{Romance} languages \citep{Manzini2011Bio}. The progressive in \ili{Conversanese} shows long-distance \is{clitic!clitic placement}clitic placement (30): the clitic climbs to a proclitic position before the auxiliary, as in the ``restructuring'' present perfect constructions in the sense of \citet{Rizzi1982}. However, there are also varieties in which the clitic is found not only in a long-distance configuration, but also as a proclitic on the embedded verb, as in the the following examples of the aspectual inflected construction from Minervino Murge (31), Montemilone (32), Mesagne (33) and Alliste (34). The examples from Mesagne (33) show that \isi{optionality} of \is{clitic!clitic placement}clitic placement is found within the same variety (33a vs. 33b). The \isi{optionality} of \is{clitic!clitic placement}clitic placement across and within varieties in \ili{Romance} shows that the parameter is independent of the monoclausal vs. biclausal status of the construction involved. In this respect, long-distance \is{clitic!clitic placement}clitic placement cannot be taken as proof of monoclausality (see \citealt{Manzini2011Bio,Manzini2017} for discussion).

As pointed out in \citet{Laka2006} for the \ili{Basque} progressive auxiliary \textit{ari}, the verb \textit{stɛ} coincides with the lexical verb ‘stay’: the same form of the verb is used for both \isi{locative}\slash progressive constructions and for sentences involving other PPs, (35). In varieties where the progressive auxiliary differs from the lexical \textit{stay}, such as in Putignano, we have the progressive forms without the connecting \isi{preposition}, (36), and the lexical \textit{stay} with a \isi{preposition}, (37).\footnote{This pattern found in the variety of Putignano is quite stable, anyway it is not found in other varieties such as that of Martina Franca, in which both the lexical and the progressive forms of stay coincide. In other varieties, the presence of a specialized progressive form does not always imply the absence of the connecting \isi{locative} element (see \citealt{Manzini2017}). Further analysis is needed in these varieties to understand the relevance of the pattern found in the variety of Putignano.}

These biclausal progressive constructions, as \citet{Manzini2005} suggest, involve \is{Event Identification}event identification between the two inflected verbs, contrary to the asyndetic constructions of the imperative in \ili{Neapolitan} \citep{Ledgeway1997}, where each verb represents an assertion (see the examples in 6-7). \isi{Event Identification} is defined by \citet{Kratzer1996} as a recursive operation involving the external argument and the aspectual reading that is applied to the event denoted by the embedded lexical VP.\footnote{In \citet{Kratzer1996}, the lexical root (embedded verb) contains information about the internal argument, but the external argument is introduced by a hierarchically superior functional head \textit{v}. This was initially posited by Kratzer as a mechanism for joining the external argument onto a verb using \isi{Voice}. \is{Event Identification}Event identifying \isi{Voice} and the verbal event adds the condition that the verb has an Agent. \is{Event Identification}Event Identification takes one function of type <e,<s,t{>}{>} (a function from individuals to functions from events to truth values) and another function of type <s,t> (a function from events to truth values) and returns a function of type <e,<s,t{>}{>}. In other words, \is{Event Identification}Event Identification combines two predicates of events by abstracting over both of their event arguments. The insight of \citegen{Kratzer1996} \is{Event Identification}Event Identification is that it is a recursive operation that allows an n-clausal syntactic structure to be mapped onto a mono-eventive semantic representation. Although T is usually assumed to close off the event variable introduced by V and \textit{v}, successive \is{Event Identification}event identifications with higher functional heads allow for different aspectual interpretations. In the cases discussed here, the recursive use of \is{Event Identification}Event Identification allows us to add (through a second recursive operation after the introduction of the external argument) further aspectual information about the event denoted by the embedded lexical verb.} It relates the external argument, introduced by a \textit{v} head or by aspectual heads, to the predicate via an identification of the event variable of the embedded predication. The overt effect of \is{Event Identification}Event Identification is the agreement morphology on both the auxiliary and the embedded verb. Roughly, \is{Event Identification}Event Identification allows us to add further aspectual information to the event described by the verb. Only if the two predicates have compatible aktionsarten may \is{Event Identification}event identification take place. With respect to the constructions discussed here, the progressive auxiliary allows for \is{Event Identification}event identification, following \citegen{Vendler1967} classification, with activities and accomplishments, but not with achievements or states.

The structure in (29) cannot be accounted for in terms of a serial verb construction if we follow \citegen{Baker1989Object} analysis, for which the serial verbs must share the same object. However, as \citet{Cruschina2013} suggests, we can consider these aspectual inflected constructions as serial verb constructions if we adopt a less rigid definition of serial verbs, such as that of \citet[12]{Aikhenvald2006}: “Prototypical serial verb constructions share at least one argument. Serial verb constructions with no shared arguments are comparatively rare, but not non-existent.” The aspectual progressive constructions under discussion share the same subject, which is also marked on the overt morphology of both verbs. 

The presence of the connecting element \textit{a} should also support an analysis of the aspectual inflected constructions as non-serial-verb constructions.\footnote{Two hypotheses are found in the literature regarding the origins of \textit{a}: (i) it comes from the Latin \isi{preposition} \textit{ad}; and (ii) it derives from the Latin coordinating conjunction \textit{ac} used in spoken and late Latin (cf. \citealt[§§710,761]{Rohlfs1969}). Although in other southern \ili{Italian} varieties there are cases in which the \textit{a} is used both as a \isi{locative} \isi{preposition} and a conjunction, in the present analysis we analyze the \textit{a} as a \isi{locative} \isi{preposition} (given the \isi{locative} nature of the progressive). Further evidence comes from the aspectual non-inflected construction in (39).} Nevertheless, in the varieties of Putignano, Martina Franca and Mesagne, we do not find such a connecting element (see Tables~\ref{tab:lorusso:2}, \ref{tab:lorusso:3}, \ref{tab:lorusso:4}). With regard to such “unstable” connecting elements found with serial verbs, \citet{Aikhenvald2006} admits that serial verb constructions “may include a special marker which distinguishes a SVC from other types of constructions but does not mark any dependency relations between the components” \citep[20]{Aikhenvald2006}. So in the case of the \isi{locative} progressive inflected structure in (29), we can call it a serial verb construction since the two verbs are inflected and the connecting \isi{locative} \isi{preposition} is a special marker of the instantiation of a central coincidence relation (not a dependency relation) between the two verbs: the output is a unique event. In contrast, the progressive \isi{locative} construction with the embedded \isi{uninflected} verb has a different structure and distribution: it does not imply \is{Event Identification}event identification and it is not a serial verb construction, since the embedded verb is an infinitival complement which is in a dependency relation with the matrix auxiliary. 

\subsection{The progressive `uninflected' constructions}% 4.2. 

In \ili{Conversanese}, there is a parallel progressive construction that we introduced in §1 and §2 and is repeated here in (39). It is formed from an inflected \isi{stative} verb \textit{stɛ} (=‘to stay’), the \isi{locative} \isi{preposition} \textit{a} and an \isi{uninflected} lexical verb (\isi{infinitive}). It differs from the aspectual inflected construction mainly in its syntactic structure and aspectual entailment.

         stay.\textsc{1sg} to   do.\textsc{inf}  the   bread\\
    \glt ‘I am making the bread.’
\z

Like the aspectual inflected progressive (30), it allows only long-distance \is{clitic!clitic placement}clitic placement, (40). But since the embedded verb is an \isi{infinitive}, it allows enclitics, (41), which are not possible with the finite verbs in the inflected aspectual counterpart.

    \glt ‘I am eating it.’
\z

As for the \isi{locative} structures in (28) and the aspectual inflected constructions in (27), we have a \isi{locative} construction where the aspectual auxiliary selects a \isi{locative} PP, but in (39) the PP introduces an \isi{infinitive} that is a full \isi{indefinite} CP\textsubscript{I} in the terms of \citet{Manzini2003}: “The domain, labelled C\textsubscript{I} ,to suggest Indefiniteness, is identified with the ‘\isi{indefinite}’ modality lexicalized by infinitivals” (\citealt[97]{Manzini2003}). The infinitival verb raises to a CP\textsubscript{I} position and the accusative enclitic is embedded in a nominal position before the the inflectional domain, as in (42).\pagebreak

The structure in (42) is a \isi{locative} structure: the subject is located in a position within the \isi{indefinite} event expressed by the embedded infinitival verb. While in (29) we have been saying that the subject is centrally located within the event denoted by the embedded lexical verb, in (42) the subject is located (not centrally) within the event. In fact, we also find this type of progressive construction with states (43) and achievements (44) that were banned for the aspectual inflected construction. In (43) and (44) the interpretation of the sentence is inchoative: the subject is located in the starting point of the event denoted by the embedded verb.

These constructions do not identify a unique event. Similarly to the asyndetic imperative constructions in \ili{Neapolitan} \citep{Ledgeway1997} in (6) and (7), these constructions may be decomposed into two subevents: the auxiliary denotes both a truly \isi{locative} and a progressive periphrasis.\footnote{They do differ from the asyndetic constructions of Ledgeway (1997), since there is a connecting element between the two verbs and they cannot be interpreted as truly paratactic constructions.} Due to the indefiniteness of the infinitival verb in CP\textsubscript{I}, the subject is controlled by the matrix subject.\footnote{For the purposes of the present work, the CPI has to be interpreted merely as tenseless, in the sense that it lacks independent tense specification and thus agrees in tense with the matrix auxiliary. However, for a complete analysis of the CPI, see \citet{Manzini2005,Manzini2007,Manzini2011Bio}.} This is confirmed by the presence of the accusative enclitic, (41-42). No special forms are found for the matrix auxiliary with the \isi{uninflected} construction (compare the specialized matrix auxiliary for the inflected construction in the varieties of Putignano, Martina Franca and Mesagne) and the connecting element can never be omitted. Nevertheless, the aspectual \isi{infinitive} constructions with the verb \textit{stay} are still interpreted as progressive constructions: they are the sole progressive forms available for 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural (§5) and they mark an ambiguous progressive form. The next section is devoted to sketching the aspectual differences between the inflected and non-inflected aspectual progressive constructions. 

\section{Aspectual analysis of the inflected and non-inflected progressive constructions}% 5. 
Both inflected and \isi{uninflected} aspectual progressive constructions are interpret\-ed as truly progressive: in both cases the event entails an ongoing reading (as in \citealt{Arosio2011} among others).\footnote{We refer all over the present paper to the progressive \isi{uninflected} constructions as opposed to the inflected ones: we want to stress simply on the fact that the embedded predicate is not inflected.} In other words, the event does not have an entailment of termination. So, for example, telic events with a natural endpoint, such as ‘eat the bread’, are interpreted as unfinished both in inflected (45) and non-inflected constructions (46).

They differ from simple present forms, since they are not found with habitual constructions, as shown in (47): in (47a) the temporal modifier ‘every year’ is found with the present tense, while we cannot find this ‘habitual’ temporal modifier with inflected (47b) and \isi{uninflected} (47c) progressives.

A major difference is found between the aspectual interpretations of the two constructions. This is linked to the episodic value of progressives: \citet{Chierchia1995}, among others, suggests that while individual-level predicates express\linebreak properties of individuals that are permanent or tendentially stable, progressives and stage-level predicates, by contrast, attribute transitional and episodic properties to individuals. Frequentative adverbs roughly indicate the repetition of the same action, and thus are mainly incompatible with progressive episodic operators. We might expect, then, that neither inflected nor \isi{uninflected} constructions can be found with \isi{frequentative} adverbs, but this is not the case: \isi{uninflected} progressives can be found with \isi{frequentative} adverbs.

In both type of constructions, the morpheme \textit{a} is the only element that can intervene between the two verbs. Adverbs like \textit{sembə} (=‘always’), which encodes \isi{frequentative} aspectual properties \citep{Cinque1999}, cannot be found between the functional and the lexical verb, but are only allowed after the complex predicate with both type of constructions, (48) and (49). Furthermore, with the ‘\isi{uninflected}’ construction in (49) we can also find the \isi{frequentative} adverb between the matrix auxiliary and the \isi{locative} PP, while it is ruled out in the inflected construction in (48).

\citet{Cardinaletti2003}, in their analysis of aspectual inflected constructions with motion verbs in Sicilian, take the different distribution of \isi{frequentative} adverbs as proof that the inflected version is monoclausal while the \isi{uninflected} one is biclausal. Our proposal, on the contrary, is that both types of progressives are biclausal. The presence of the \isi{frequentative} temporal \isi{quantifier} with the \isi{uninflected} construction is linked to the \isi{indefinite} CP\textsubscript{I} selected by the \isi{locative} \isi{preposition}. The subject of the embedded verb in CP\textsubscript{I} must receive a variable\slash operator interpretation, since no person and number morphology is found on it as in the control constructions. The subject of the matrix auxiliary is just located within the event denoted by the embedded verb, but it is not in a central coincidence relation with the embedded predicate. The \isi{frequentative} adverbial modifier can bind the variable introduced by the embedded infinitival verb in (49) and allow a \isi{frequentative} interpretation of the progressive \isi{locative} construction.\footnote{Since the embedded verb is tenseless and aspectless, an adverb can work as an operator that binds it, intervening, as a modifier, in the aspectual relation instantiated between the matrix aspectual auxiliary and the embedded verb: the embedded verb, in fact, has no overt morphology marking its inherent aspect, so its aspect can be more easily modified\slash marked by an (extra) adverbial item.} The double inflection of (48), on the other hand, marks the fact that \is{Event Identification}event identification has taken place and the fact that the subject is centrally located within the event denoted by the embedded predicate: no temporal and aspectual binding is possible, since both the auxiliary and the embedded verb show the same inflectional morphology. Nevertheless, besides these minor aspectual differences, both types of constructions still imply a progressive reading: the ‘\isi{uninflected}’ construction, in fact, is the only progressive form found with the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural. The next section is devoted to analysing the distribution of the aspectual constructions inflected for person and number.

\section{Person split in the progressive aspectual inflected constructions}% 6. 

The progressive aspectual inflected construction is not found with 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural. As we mentioned in §1, (3-4), repeated here as (50-51), the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural do not allow the progressive constructions involving the inflected embedded verb (50), but are only found in the construction involving an embedded infinitival verb, (51).

Similar data are also found in other varieties. \citet{Cardinaletti2003} found a similar pattern in their analysis of the inflected constructions in the dialect of Marsala. \citet{Manzini2005} mention many other southern varieties (not only in \il{Apulian}Apulia) in which the aspectual inflected constructions are not found with 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural, while the other persons allow it; (51) and (52) provide examples from the Sicilian varieties of Villadoro e Calascibetta.

Why do the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural not allow the \textit{a}+inflected form construction? Is it worth talking of a \isi{person split}person split? Our answer is that the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural are referentially more complex than the other singular and plural (3\textsuperscript{rd}) persons. Their complexity is linked to the fact that the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural are not merely plural versions of the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons singular. In this sense we are dealing with a \isi{person split}person split different from the one attested for the singular persons in auxiliary selection (\citealt{Manzini2005,Manzini2007,Manzini2011Bio}).

\citet{Bobaljik2008Missing} proposes a two-valued binary feature system \is{speaker}[±speaker] and [±\isi{hearer}] to account for the personal pronominal system across languages.\footnote{With varying choices of feature labels, a similar argument has been presented and defended in one form or another by \citet{Ingram1978,Harley2002Person} and, in particular detail, \citet[Chapter~2]{Noyer1997}.} The two-valued person feature system lacks a feature ‘third person’, which is then analyzed as [\is{speaker}\textminus{}speaker, \textminus{}\isi{hearer}]. For plural persons, \citet{Bobaljik2008Missing} argues, along the lines of \citet{Lyons1968} and \citet{Benveniste1966}, that 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural are not merely plurals of the singular 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons: “We (‘first person plural’) does not normally stand in the same relationship to I (‘first person singular’) as boys, cows, etc., do to boy, cow, etc. The pronoun we is to be interpreted as ‘I, in addition to one or more other persons’… In other words, we is not ‘the plural of I’: rather, it includes a reference to ‘I’ and is plural” \citet[277]{Lyons1968}. So Bobalijk suggests that “[i]t is indeed meaningful to speak of a first person plural, but it is important to note that plural, for the first person, normally means an associative or group plural, rather than a multiplicity of individuals sharing the property \is{speaker}[speaker]” \citep[209]{Bobaljik2008Missing}. The same is also true of the 2\textsuperscript{nd} person plural, which is not merely the plural of singular \textit{you}. So while the 1\textsuperscript{st} person plural is not just a sum of \is{speaker}[speaker], but is the sum of \is{speaker}speaker plus others, the 2\textsuperscript{nd} person plural is not just a sum of [\isi{hearer}], but is the sum of \isi{hearer} plus others. Furthermore, \citet{Bobaljik2008Missing} resumes this discussion by saying that while the 1\textsuperscript{st} person plural is the sum of all persons, (54), the 2\textsuperscript{nd} person plural is the sum of all persons excluding the \is{speaker}[speaker].

Following similar considerations on the person system, \citeauthor{Manzini2007}\linebreak (\citeyear{Manzini2007,Manzini2011Bio}) use a \isi{person split}person split analysis to describe the patterns found in other constructions (i.e. auxiliary selection with present perfect) where the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons singular (discourse-anchored pronouns: \is{speaker}[+speaker, +\isi{hearer}]) and the 3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular (event-anchored pronouns: \is{speaker}[\textminus{}speaker, \textminus{}\isi{hearer}])\linebreak show different morphosyntactic patterns. For the analysis of plural persons, \citet{Manzini2011Bio} argue that “the 1st person plural does not necessarily denote a plurality of \is{speaker}speakers (though it may), or the \is{speaker}speaker and \isi{hearer} only (though again it may); rather its denotation routinely involves one \is{speaker}speaker and a certain number of other individuals that are being referred to together with the \is{speaker}speaker. The same is true for the 2nd person singular, which does not necessarily (or normally) denote a plurality of \is{hearer}hearers but simply refers to the \isi{hearer} taken together with a certain number of other individuals …Because of this referential structure of the so-called 1st and 2nd plural, it is reasonable to propose that even varieties that activate the \isi{person split}person split in the singular may not do so in the plural” \citep[213]{Manzini2011Bio}. In a lexical parametrization approach \citep{Manzini1987,Manzini2011Bio}, languages involve a parametric distinction for plural on the one hand and the discourse participants and event participants may not apply in the plural. 

With respect to the constructions being discussed here, the \isi{person split}person split we found in the aspectual inflected progressive of \ili{Conversanese} is not directly linked to the split involving discourse vs. event participants, but to the referential complexity of the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural. More precisely, we have been contending that the progressive aspectual inflected constructions are based on a \isi{locative} structure where the subject of the matrix subject enters into a central coincidence relation within the event denoted by the embedded predicates (as in \citealt{Mateu1999}; \citealt{Laka2006}). The 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural may not enter into this derivation because the referential complexity of the plurality does not allow the instantiation of a central coincidence relation as tight as the one found in the aspectual inflected constructions with other persons, (29). The main idea is that the central coincidence relation entails a reading for which a referentially unique (easily identifiable) event participant is centrally located within the eventive structure. 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural, however, cannot be centrally located due to their referential complexity, which does not allow the identification of a unique participant or group of participants. That is, only clearly identifiable referents can be centrally located in the aspectual progressive constructions, at least in \ili{Conversanese}. The microparametric variation in the aspectual inflected constructions (see §2.2) shows that different dimensions may determine the finite\slash non-finite split (person and number features, reduced inflectional paradigms, \textit{a}/bare embedding). \ili{Conversanese} does not allow finite embedding, which encodes a central coincidence relation, for referentially unclear referents; this is an interpretative requirement which blocks the \is{agreement!multiple agreement}multiple agreement configurations for 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural.\footnote{While some authors define agreement as a mere computational mechanism at work in syntax that may or may not involve a semantic counterpart (the case of \is{agreement!default agreement}default agreement, as in \citealt{Preminger2014}), others claim that agreement always plays a role in semantic interpretation \citep{Manzini2007,Manzini2011Bio}. On this view, agreement does not involve a feature{}-checking operation, but in the terms of \citet{Manzini2007} it represents the sharing of referentially relevant properties that play a role in semantic interpretation. So, under our proposal double agreement represents a marked aspectual reading at the semantic interface, which is obtained through \is{Event Identification}event identification.} To express the progressive with the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural, the subject is ‘located’ within the event denoted by the embedded verb, but this \isi{locative} relation is not a central coincidence relation (§4.1): the different aspectual flavors of the two constructions interact with the referential complexity of the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} plural persons.

\section{Conclusions}% 7. 
In this paper, we have presented a preliminary analysis of the progressive form in a number of \ili{Apulian} dialects, focusing on the variety of \il{Conversanese}Conversano (Apulia). In \ili{Conversanese}, two forms of the progressive are available. Both constructions are formed from an inflected \isi{stative} verb, a connecting \isi{preposition} and a lexical verb. The two constructions differ in the inflection found on the lexical verb selected by the \isi{preposition}: one type of construction involves an inflected embedded verb, and we have defined this as the aspectual (progressive) inflected construction (following \citealt{Manzini2005}); the other type of construction involves an \isi{uninflected} embedded lexical verb, and we have defined this as the aspectual \isi{uninflected} construction. 

Both types of structure share a \isi{locative} derivation: the majority of progressive forms crosslinguistically, in fact, are derived from expressions involving \isi{stative} auxiliaries and\slash or \isi{locative} prepositions (\citealt{Bybee1994}, \citealt{Mateu1999}, \citealt{Laka2006}). In (29) and (42) we proposed a biclausal syntactic derivation for both inflected and \isi{uninflected} progressive constructions. The difference is that, while in the inflected construction the \isi{locative} \isi{preposition} selects a full IP, in the \isi{uninflected} one the \isi{locative} \isi{preposition} selects an \isi{indefinite} CP\textsubscript{I}. The distinction between the structures has been used to account for the different syntactic and aspectual properties of the two progressive constructions. 

On the one hand, the aspectual inflected constructions: 1) denote an \is{Event Identification}event identification between the auxiliary and the lexical verb; 2) seem to work like serial verb constructions; 3) allow long-distance \is{clitic!clitic placement}clitic placement; and 4) locate the matrix subject of the inflected progressive centrally within the event denoted by the embedded verb. On the other hand, the aspectual \isi{uninflected} progressive constructions: 1) may denote a a \isi{frequentative} aspectual reading; 2) seem to work like control constructions; 3) allow enclitic placement on the embedded infinitival verb; 4) locate the subject in a given position (although not in a central coincidence relation) within the event denoted by the embedded verb. 

The 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural are not found in the aspectual inflected constructions, but are only possible in the infinitival counterpart. Differences in the pattern of the morphological derivation of 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} persons plural are quite common (\citealt{Manzini2005,Manzini2011Bio}) across \ili{Romance} languages: these persons are more complex than other persons \citep{Bobaljik2008Missing} because they involve a complex reference to the discourse participants (as with 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} singular), to the plurality of participants and to the event participants. However, further analysis is needed in order to account for the nature of this \isi{person split}person split: for present purposes, the complexity of the referentiality seems to pattern with certain aspectual interpretations (such as the inchoative interpretation attributed to (43-44) when the embedded verb is infinitival) linked to the complex referentiality, such as the inclusion\slash exclusion of the subject(s) within the complex \isi{locative}\slash progressive constructions, which involve an \is{Event Identification}event identification\slash change. In a lexical parametrization analysis (\citealt{Manzini2011Bio}), languages involve a parametric distinction for plural persons: the difference between discourse participants and event participants found in the singular (1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} singular person vs. 3\textsuperscript{rd} person) may not apply in the plural, but different overlapping referents may influence the status of the plural persons and imply their overt morphological realization as a parametric choice across languages.
