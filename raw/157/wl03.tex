\section{Introduction}
This chapter looks at the historical relationship between the Papuan languages of Alor-Pantar (AP) and those of Timor-Kisar (TK). The TK group of Papuan languages consists of Bunaq\il{Bunaq}, spoken in central Timor; Makasae\il{Makasae}, Makalero\il{Makalero} and Fataluku\il{Fataluku}, three languages spoken in a contiguous region of far eastern Timor; and Oirata\il{Oirata}, spoken on the southern side of Kisar Island to the north of Timor. Due to their geographical proximity, AP and TK languages have typically been assumed to be related to one another (e.g., \citealt{Stokhof1975,Capell1975}). Together they have been referred to as the Timor-Alor-Pantar (TAP) family. However, there has been no substantive data-driven investigation of the claim of relatedness.

In this chapter, we test the hypothesis that AP and TK languages are related to one another through the application of the comparative method. Specifically, we compare the results of two recent reconstructions, the one of AP \citep{HoltonEtAl2012} and the other of TK \citep{SchapperEtAl2012}. We establish that the AP and TK languages are indeed related by demonstrating that there are regular sound correspondences across cognate vocabulary between the two groups. 

In comparing \citet{HoltonEtAl2012} and \citet{SchapperEtAl2012} in this chapter, we assume the existence of two nodes in the TAP tree, namely Proto-Alor-Pantar (pAP)\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and Proto-Timor (pTIM)\il{proto-Timor}. Whilst pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} appears to be a robust node, the existence of pTIM\il{proto-Timor} is less secure. As \citet[227-228]{SchapperEtAl2012} point out, it is possible that Bunaq\il{Bunaq} and the Eastern Timor languages (reconstructed as Proto-ET\il{proto-Eastern Timor} in \citealt{SchapperEtAl2012}) both form their own separate primary subgroups within TAP. Our aim here is not to make claims about the high-level subgrouping of the AP and TK languages, and we do not presume to definitively determine the constituency of the TK-AP tree at this stage, but merely seek to show that TK and AP languages are related. Conclusive evidence of innovations\is{innovation} shared by Bunaq\il{Bunaq} and ET languages to the exclusion of AP languages is the subject of ongoing research.

\sectref{sec:3:2} presents the sound correspondences we find in cognate vocabulary between pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\il{proto-Timor}. \sectref{sec:3:3} summarizes our preliminary findings and discusses issues arising out of them.  Appendices are included with supporting language data for any reconstructions that do not appear in \citet{HoltonEtAl2012} or \citet{SchapperEtAl2012}, as well as a list of pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} forms that can be reconstructed on the basis of the sound correspondences identified in this chapter. New, additional reconstructions have in some cases been necessary since the two articles each reconstruct only a small number of lexemes with only partial overlap between them.  The sources of the lexical data used are listed in the Appendices. We also throw out several cognate sets from the AP reconstruction as they reflect borrowing\is{borrowing} from Austronesian languages\il{Austronesian language(s)}. 

\section{Sound correspondences}\label{sec:3:2}
In this section, we describe the consonant correspondences that we have identified between AP and TK languages. We do draw on vowel correspondences where they condition particular sound changes in consonants, but otherwise do not deal with vowels in this preliminary demonstration of relatedness. We chiefly draw attention to the correspondences in cognate vocabulary between pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\il{proto-Timor}. However, we provide the reader also with the forms of the lexemes in the TK languages as they are not available elsewhere in this volume. The argumentation and underpinning data for pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} is given in \citet{HoltonRobinsonTVhistory} and is based on \citet{HoltonEtAl2012}.

In the subsections that follow, transcription of language data adheres to IPA conventions. Long vowels are indicated with a length mark `{\textlengthmark}'. Bracketed segments `( )' are those deemed to be non-etymological, that is, typically reflecting some morpheme which has fossilized on a root. In the correspondence tables, square brackets `[]' are used where an item is cognate but doesn't reflect the segment in question. The inverted question mark `?`' is used where a cognate shows an unexpected reflex of the segment in question. Grammatical items are glossed in small caps. Reconstructions marked with `!!' are new reconstructions not found in or revised from \citet{HoltonEtAl2012} or \citet{SchapperEtAl2012}. The symbol `!!' signals that the full data set on which the reconstruction in question is based is given in the Appendices. AP data supporting the additional pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} reconstructions is given in Appendix \ref{sec:3:app:1} and TK data in Appendix \ref{sec:3:app:2}. In the text of the chapter itself, for reasons of compactness, we only give simple one-word glosses which reflect the presumed meaning of the proto-lexeme. Should the reader need more information on semantics, he can refer to the Appendices. We also do not provide information on irregular changes, such as metathesis\is{metathesis} or apocope\is{apocope}, in the correspondence tables, except where directly relevant to the reconstruction of the segment in question. The Appendix provides the reader with fuller information on any irregularities in form or meaning in individual languages. 

\subsection{Reconstruction of bilabial stops}
We identify two robust correspondent sets for bilabial plosives, reconstructing to pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *p and *b. Note that in \citet{SchapperEtAl2012}, we reconstruct a three-way distinction (*p, *b, and *f) for bilabial obstruents in pTIM\il{proto-Timor}, despite the fact that it is not maintained in any of the modern TK languages: Bunaq\il{Bunaq}, Makasae\il{Makasae} and Makalero\il{Makalero} have merged reflexes of pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *p and *f, whereas in Fataluku\il{Fataluku} and Oirata\il{Oirata}, *p and *b are merged. We find no evidence to support a three-way split in pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar}; instead, it looks like pTIM\il{proto-Timor} underwent a conditioned phoneme split, with distinct reflexes of pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *b in initial and non-initial positions, respectively. 

\newpage 
Table~\ref{tab:3:1} and Table~\ref{tab:3:2} present the forms for these two correspondence sets respectively. In the first, pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *p corresponds to pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *f in all positions. In the second, pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *b was retained as *b in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar}, but split to pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *b initially and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *p non-initially. In these sets, there are two notable irregularities: 
(i) pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *tiara `expel' lost the medial bilabial that is retained in pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *tifar `run'; and 
(ii) pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *karab `scratch' and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *gabar `scratch', which show an irregular correspondence of pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *b with pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *b in medial position.

\textsuperscript{1} Several AP languages have a compound for `star', although the second element does not appear to be cognate to that reconstructed for pTIM\ilt{proto-Timor}. Note also that \citet{HoltonEtAl2012} gave this item as *jibC.
% ; this error has been corrected for \citet{HoltonRobinsonTVhistory}.

\textsuperscript{2} The Bunaq\ilt{Bunaq} form reflects the second half of the pTIM\ilt{proto-Timor} doublet that is not found in AP languages.

\textsuperscript{3} The cognate set for this item is given in \citet{HoltonEtAl2012}, but no pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} reconstruction is given.

\textsuperscript{4} The reflex of the relevant bilabial has been lost in Makalero\ilt{Makalero} due to apocope\ist{apocope}.

\textsuperscript{5} The cognate set for this item is given in \citet{HoltonEtAl2012}, but no pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} reconstruction is given.

\textsuperscript{6} This form shows liquid-stop metathesis\ist{metathesis}. There is no evidence of *b occurring word-finally in pTIM\ilt{proto-Timor}.
\end{sidewaystable}



% At this stage, we have no evidence for the reconstruction of a third bilabial obstruent to pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar}, as is found in pTIM\il{proto-Timor} (*p, *b and *f), but not pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} (*p and*b). Based on the current correspondence sets, the three-way distinction appears to have arisen due to pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} medial *b changing to pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *p, while pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *b stayed *b initially in pTIM\il{proto-Timor}. We are yet to find any AP cognates for words reconstructing with initial *p in pTIM\il{proto-Timor}.

\subsection{Reconstruction of coronal stops}
There are two coronal stops, *t and *d, reconstructed to pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar}, and four, *t, *d, *T and *D to pTIM\il{proto-Timor}. \citet{SchapperEtAl2012} note the uncertainty of pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *d, which is supported by three cognate sets only, all of which are in initial position. This is played out also when comparing coronals between AP and TK languages. We can reconstruct the pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} coronal stops *t with relative certainty, and *d, albeit with less security. The latter segment split in pTIM\il{proto-Timor} to *T and *D. At present, we cannot reconstruct pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *d to pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar}. There are, however, a substantial number of coronal correspondences which remain unexplained. 

Our most consistent correspondence is pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *t to pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *t and *s (Table~\ref{tab:3:3}). Initially, we find a steady and unchanging correspondence of pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *t and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *t, supported by a sizeable number of cognates. Only Bunaq\il{Bunaq} shows a change of *t to /t{\textesh}/ before a high front vowel. Non-initially, we find fewer cognates, but nevertheless a steady and unchanging correspondence. In two cognate sets (`sit' and `mat'), pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} final *s preceded by *i corresponds to pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *t.

\textsuperscript{1} Bunaq\ilt{Bunaq} /o/ is a regular reflex of pTIM\ilt{proto-Timor} *a, as seen, for instance, from the `hand', `sea', `tree' and `clew' sets. 
\end{sidewaystable}


The reconstruction of pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *d is supported by only a small number of cognate sets (Table~\ref{tab:3:4}) and therefore still needs confirmation. In these sets, initial pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *d corresponds to pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *D, while non-initial pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *d corresponds with pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *T. This is consistent with what we observed with the bilabial stops, where a medial voiced stop in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} corresponds to a voiceless stop in pTIM\il{proto-Timor}. Note that the cognate set for `bird' is listed under the heading of initial *d, even though its pTIM\il{proto-Timor} and (arguably) pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} reflexes are in medial position. We place it there due to the fact that the sound correspondence is parallel to that for `rat'. However, more sets supporting this reconstruction are clearly needed before we can be certain of it.

\textsuperscript{1} We note the irregularity of pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *jibar `dog' where we would expect pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *dibar `dog'. This is likely the result of a change pre-pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *d {\textgreater} *j.

\textsuperscript{2} The cognate set for this item is given in \citet{SchapperEtAl2012}, but no pTIM\ilt{proto-Timor} reconstruction is given.

\end{sidewaystable}


Furthermore, there are a range of cognate sets which show as yet unexplained correspondences (Table~\ref{tab:3:5}). In these, we find coronal correspondences between pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\ilt{proto-Timor} and between TK languages (especially in Bunaq\il{Bunaq} and Fataluku\ilt{Fataluku}) that don't fit well in the above given sets. More work is needed to clarify the history of the coronals in TAP.

\subsection{Reconstruction of velar stops}
We reconstruct two velar stops for pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar}, *k and *g. We find insufficient evidence, however, for the uvular stop reconstructed for pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} in \citet{HoltonEtAl2012} and \citet{HoltonRobinsonTVhistory}. 

PTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *k and *g are retained as *k and *g in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar}, but merged to *g in pTIM\il{proto-Timor}. Note that, based on the comparative TAP evidence and the additional pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} reconstructions in this chapter, we have to substantially revise \citeauthor{SchapperEtAl2012}'s (2012) pTIM\il{proto-Timor} reconstructions with regard to velar stops. Concretely, we can trace only one pTIM\il{proto-Timor} velar back to pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar}. We find no pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} reflexes for any of the small sets of roots reconstructed for pTIM\il{proto-Timor} with initial *k and medial *g; those for pTIM\il{proto-Timor} medial *g, in particular, are rather tenuous, as noted in \citet[212]{SchapperEtAl2012}. The cognate sets that we can trace back to pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} involve \citeauthor{SchapperEtAl2012}'s initial *g and medial *k, and the comparative evidence is consistent with these being differential realizations of a single pTIM\il{proto-Timor} segment *g: initially, pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *g is reflected as /g/ in Bunaq\il{Bunaq} and Makasae\il{Makasae}, and as /k/ in Makalero\il{Makalero} and Fataluku\il{Fataluku}. We currently have no evidence for Oirata\il{Oirata}. In non-initial position, *g is reflected in Bunaq\il{Bunaq} as /g/ medially and as /k/ finally, consistent with Bunaq\il{Bunaq} phonotactic rules, which prohibit voiced stops from codas; in Makasae\il{Makasae}, Makalero\il{Makalero} and Fataluku\il{Fataluku}, *g is reflected in non-initial position as /{\textglotstop}/, and variably as /{\textglotstop}/ and {\O} in Oirata\il{Oirata}.

The cognate sets that support the reconstruction of pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *k are given in Table~\ref{tab:3:6}. 
As in both pTIM\il{proto-Timor} \citep[213-214]{SchapperEtAl2012} and pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} \citep[98]{HoltonEtAl2012}, the reconstruction of initial *g in pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} hinges on third person markers. Two forms are reconstructable (Table~\ref{tab:3:7}): a prefix *ga `3'
% `3\textsc{inln}' 
occurring on verbs and inalienably\is{alienability} possessed\is{possession} nouns, and a free form *gie 
`3.\textsc{poss}'
encoding 3\textsuperscript{rd} person alienable\is{alienability} possessors\is{possession}. Number marking was lost in TK languages, so the correspondence we observe is between pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} third person singular forms and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} third person forms which are unmarked for number (i.e., can be used in singular and plural\is{plurality} contexts). The zero correspondence that we observe in Fataluku\il{Fataluku} and Oirata\il{Oirata} is the result of the stripping off of the *g marking 3\textsuperscript{rd} person (as set out in \citealt[214]{SchapperEtAl2012}). In the case of the alienable\is{alienability} possessive\is{possession} marker, this means we are left with reflexes of the pTIM possessive\is{possession} root
%  pTIM\il{proto-Timor} 
*-ie 
`\textsc{poss}' 
alone.

\textsuperscript{1} We reconstruct this as a free form on account of the existence of free reflexes in at least two AP languages (Blagar\ilt{Blagar} and Adang\ilt{Adang}); morphologization must thus post-date the break-up of pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar}.

Loss of *g is found occasionally in AP languages (e.g. `laugh', see Appendix \ref{sec:3:app:1}), suggesting a certain degree of instability for this segment.

Finally, there is as yet an insufficient number of reconstructions of pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *q with cognates in TK languages to allow for a higher-level pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} reconstruction. Currently, we have only Bunaq\il{Bunaq} \textit{{}-ol} `child' (presumably reflecting pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *-al) as cognate with pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *-uaqal `child'. We await further reconstructions with TK cognates for the determination of the pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} form.

\subsection{Reconstruction of fricatives}
Two fricatives *s and *h can be reconstructed to pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar}. The number of cognates is still small for both phonemes, but the correspondences are relatively well-behaved. 

Table~\ref{tab:3:9} sets out the cognate sets for pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *s. Initial pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *s is supported by several cognate sets and has been maintained without change in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\il{proto-Timor}. Non-initial cognates of pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *s are difficult to find in TK languages, as many instances of reconstructed word-final *s in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} correspond to pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *t (e.g., pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *mis `sit', *bis `mat' and *has `excrement').

PTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *h can be reconstructed as a word-initial segment, but not in other positions. The segment corresponds to pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *h and pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *h except before back vowels (Table~\ref{tab:3:10}). Based on the cognate sets available, pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *h did not occur before back vowels. In this environment, pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *h changed either to *w (as in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *wur `moon') or was lost (as in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *tei `tree') in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} (cf. Table~\ref{tab:3:11} for the items and vocalic environments in which pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *w is attested). The reconstruction of pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *h hinges on Bunaq\il{Bunaq}, which retains it as /h/, while the eastern Timor languages have all lost pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *h (which, in turn, reflects pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *h). This means that where we have no Bunaq\il{Bunaq} reflex (as in the `fish' and `breast' sets) we have no modern language attesting pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *h, and the presence of the phoneme can only be inferred from the fact that *h is reconstructed for the pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} cognate.

\subsection{Reconstruction of glides}
Two glides can be reconstructed to pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar}, *w and *j. Both appear to have only occurred in initial position. It is unclear whether the reconstructed glides could occur before all vowel qualities. Nevertheless, the cognate sets supporting these proto-phonemes are robust and show little irregularity.

The pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} glide *w shows a stable and unchanging correspondence of *w in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} for the most part (Table~\ref{tab:3:11}). The major change is that pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *w is vocalized in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} to *u root-initially on inalienably\is{alienability} possessed\is{possession} nouns. In TK languages, Bunaq\il{Bunaq} shows conditioned reflexes of pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *w, maintaining it as /w/ before front vowels, but changing it to /h/ before non-front vowels. Fataluku\il{Fataluku} shows a change of *w to /{\textbeta}/, though we note that this is an allophone of /w/ in many languages.
 


Table~\ref{tab:3:12} gives the four clear cognate sets that we have across TAP languages for pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *j. We see that pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *j is maintained as *j in pAP, but is variably lost or maintained as *j in pTIM\il{proto-Timor}. It may be that differing vocalic environments in pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} conditioned the different reflexes in pTIM\il{proto-Timor}, but we don't have enough understanding of the history of vowels yet to determine this. There is no direct evidence for pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *j, that is, no TK language still reflects the proto-phoneme as /j/, but the sound correspondences between TK languages make it differentiable form sets reflecting pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *h (see Table~\ref{tab:3:10}).

\subsection{Reconstruction of liquids}
We identify three robust liquid correspondence sets between pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} and as such reconstruct three pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} liquids: *r, *R, and *l.

The most robust set is that for pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *r, which is reflected as *r in both pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} (Table~\ref{tab:3:13}). PTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *r is only found in non-initial positions, as are its reflexes in the daughter languages pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\il{proto-Timor}. Word-finally in polysyllabic words pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *r is particularly susceptible to sporadic loss, as is attested by the various irregular forms in Table~\ref{tab:3:13}. In one instance (pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *(t, s)iba(r) `new'), the occurrence of a reflex of final *r is so erratic in both primary subgroups that we perhaps must consider it already partly lost in pTAP's\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} daughter languages.

PTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *R is reflected in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} as *r and in pTIM\il{proto-Timor} as *l. Like pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *r, *R does not appear in word-initial positions and is sporadically lost word-finally in polysyllabic words. The sets supporting the reconstruction of *R (Table~\ref{tab:3:14}) are also fewer and less robust than for pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *r.

The three pTIM\il{proto-Timor} cognates listed in Table~\ref{tab:3:15} are based on Bunaq\il{Bunaq} only, in which pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *r and *R are merged. We have thus no means of determining whether these forms are to be reconstructed to pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} with *r or with *R.

Cognate sets for pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *l are relatively infrequent in both pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} (Table~\ref{tab:3:16}).\footnote{\citet{HoltonRobinsonTVhistory} remark that, even though correspondences appear relatively regular for initial and medial *l in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar}, they can identify only a few cognates that are widely distributed across the AP subgroup. Similarly, \citet[216]{SchapperEtAl2012} caution that their reconstruction for pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *l cannot yet be called secure due to the small number of cognate sets identified.} Cognates reflecting initial pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *l with pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *l and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *l (i.e., `bark', `new place' and `crouch') have only a low degree of certainty. Based on the data available, there also appears to be a tendency to lose pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} initial *l in pTIM\il{proto-Timor}, as in `far', `tongue' and `green', but a clear conditioning environment for this is not yet obvious. Word-finally in polysyllabic words, pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *l is regularly lost in pTIM\il{proto-Timor}, as in `banana', `bat', `bird' and `taboo', However, it is retained in `walk 2' and `six', apparently due to nasal-liquid metathesis\is{metathesis}, and in `child' due to the loss of the item's medial syllable with *q prior to the application of the final polysyllabic deletion rule in pTIM.

Finally, there are several cases in which the appearance of liquids in AP and TK languages can be reconciled with none of the three sets we have identified here. Table~\ref{tab:3:17} lists these problematic instances (the relevant segments are bolded). These sets pointedly express that we are still a long way away from a complete understanding of liquids in pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar}. 
 

\subsection{Reconstruction of nasals}
Two nasals can be reconstructed to pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar}, *m and *n. For the most part, they are relatively stable and unchanging in both pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\il{proto-Timor}.

Table~\ref{tab:3:18} presents a selection of the many cognate sets for pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *m. In word-initial position, pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *m corresponds unproblematically to pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *m and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *m. Identifying non-initial instances of pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} *m is somewhat more difficult, with *hami `breast' being the only straightforward case. Word-final *m in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} has only non-final reflexes in pTIM\il{proto-Timor}, apparently because, as in the modern TK languages, word-final *m was not permitted. This issue is resolved in pTIM\il{proto-Timor} through metathesis\is{metathesis} of the nasal out of the final position, as in `sea' and `six'. Other instances of medial pTIM\il{proto-Timor} *m correspond to root-initial *m in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} (as in `garden' and `die').

\section{Summary of correspondences and reconstructed phonemes}\label{sec:3:3}
For the first time since the start of TAP studies some sixty years ago (see \citealt{SchapperEtAlforthcoming} for a historical perspective on TAP studies), we have rigorously shown in this chapter that the TAP languages form a family: the regularity of sound correspondences in cognate vocabulary demonstrates that the AP and TK Papuan languages are indeed genetically related to one another.

In Table~\ref{tab:3:20}, we provide an overview of the consonant correspondences we observed in cognate vocabulary between pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} and their reconstruction in their ancestral language pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar}. In this table, we indicate whether the correspondence applies in initial (\#\_ ), medial (V\_V), or final ( \_\#) position. An empty slot means that there is no particular conditioning environment for the correspondence. The symbol `{\O}' in a column indicates that a pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} sound is lost in the daughter language in question.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:3:4}
Whilst we have been able to show clearly that AP and TK languages are related to one another, the comparative data presented here draws into question a number of aspects of the existing reconstructions of pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} and necessitates revisions to these. In this final section, we will draw attention to the issues, provide a general discussion of them and suggest some possible solutions.

A major issue for the current pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} reconstruction is the apparent invalidity of many word-final consonant reconstructions. It is argued in \citet[95]{HoltonEtAl2012} that the gemination of medial stops in modern Western Pantar\il{Western Pantar} can be used as a diagnostic for determining whether a given pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} root was consonant-final or vowel-final. Specifically, the authors claim that geminate medial stops in modern Western Pantar\il{Western Pantar} reflect pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} medial stops, whereas non-geminate medial stops in Western Pantar\il{Western Pantar} reflect an original consonant-final form, or perhaps a borrowing\is{borrowing} from another AP language. However, this argument cannot be sustained on closer inspection of the comparative evidence. Consider the items in Table~\ref{tab:3:21} that are reconstructed as basically consonant final in pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar}, because of the lack of stop gemination in Western Pantar\il{Western Pantar}. In each case, we have between three and nine reflexes in modern AP languages with a V(C) following the supposed historically final consonant. We must ask ourselves where so many additional final segments came from in so many of these languages. \citet{HoltonEtAl2012} seek to explain these appearances with vowel epenthesis\is{epenthesis}. Yet, under this scenario, we would expect to be able to predict the type of the epenthetic\is{epenthesis} vowel from the shape of the root, but this is not the case; instead, the epenthetic\is{epenthesis} vowels are of all different values from one item to the next and bear no apparent relationship to the vowel of the root (as defined by \citealt{HoltonEtAl2012}). What is more, the final V(C) elements we observe in AP languages are not erratic, rather they in general adhere to correspondences observed elsewhere. This suggests that these final V(C) elements were not epenthetic\is{epenthesis} to the items after the break-up of pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar}, but have been inherited from pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar}. This is further supported by the fact that we find clearly corresponding V(C) segments on cognate vocabulary in TK languages, meaning that the segments reconstruct to pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} and that they were inherited into pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar}. The alternative leaves us without explanation for the cognacy of the final segments in these (and other) items across the family.

\textsuperscript{1} \citet{HoltonEtAl2012} state that these and other Kamang\ilt{Kamang} forms missing pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *l medially are irregular. However, pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *l is regularly lost in Kamang\ilt{Kamang} between non-front vowels, e.g., pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *talam `six' {\textgreater} Kamang\ilt{Kamang} \textit{ta{\textlengthmark}m}, pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *palol `taboo'{\textgreater} Kamang\ilt{Kamang} \textit{fo{\textlengthmark}i} etc. The vowel of the inalienable\ist{alienability} possessive\ist{possession} prefix is /a/, thus providing the right environment for the loss in \textit{{}-opui} `tongue' of the root-initial /l/.  
\end{sidewaystable}

\newpage 
The problem then is how to explain medial geminate and non-geminate stops in Western Pantar\il{Western Pantar}. One answer would be to maintain that the difference in stop gemination was still due to a final versus non-final distinction. For example, it could be said that the loss of the final vowel occurred after the breakup of pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} but prior to the application of the gemination rule. This cannot, however, be fully sustained as WP\il{Western Pantar} has in some cases final vowels which clearly reflect pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} and pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} (e.g., `tongue'). A more attractive explanation is presented by stress-induced gemination. Although little is known about the historical prosody of TAP, it seems a good possibility that Western Pantar\il{Western Pantar} gemination may have been a result of final stress. 
This scenario is supported by and elaborated in \citegen{Heston2016} analysis of pTAP stress, according to which closed final syllables attracted stress. Western Pantar\il{Western Pantar} geminate stops occur predictably before stressed final vowels (even if the syllable in question is no longer closed in modern Western Pantar). This analysis explains the lack of gemination in our examples in \tabref{tab:3:21}, with the exception of pTAP *\textit{lebur} `tongue' and *\textit{wasin} `tooth'. With respect to the latter, \citet[288]{Heston2016} notes that his stress-based account does not hold for geminate s and l. The former case remains unexplained.

While this scenario remains to be confirmed by a more detailed study, discarding the final/non-final explanation for geminates in WP\il{Western Pantar} allows for a more satisfactory account of final segments in pAP.

A second issue for the pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} reconstruction is the presence of many unexplained phonemes in a range of environments in different languages. Velar, post-velar and laryngeal consonants are a case in point. Most of the complexity in this domain is found in the languages of Pantar and the Pantar Straits, whose phoneme inventories generally include not only velar and glottal stops, but also uvular ones, as well as a velar or pharyngeal fricative next to the glottal fricative /h/. This contrasts with the situation as found in most of Alor and the TK languages, which tend to be rather simpler. Table~\ref{tab:3:22} exemplifies the velar and post-velar plosives and fricatives in a language of Pantar (Teiwa\il{Teiwa}), Alor (Kamang\il{Kamang}), and Timor (Bunaq\il{Bunaq}).

\label{tab:3:22} 
\end{table} 

The existing pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} reconstruction leaves a significant part of the complexity in the (post\nobreakdash-)velar domain in the Pantar languages unexplained; for instance, it does not account for /g/ in Blagar\il{Blagar} and the relation between the various (post-)velar phonemes such as /q/ and /x/ found in different dialects of Blagar\il{Blagar} \citep{Steinhauer1995}. It also does not explain the origin of /{\textglotstop}/ in languages other than Blagar\il{Blagar} and Adang\il{Adang}, and does not give reflexes for pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} medial *k in Teiwa\il{Teiwa} and pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} final *k in Sawila\il{Sawila}, leaving the field in question blank in the table summarising the correspondences \citep{HoltonRobinsonTVhistory}. Finally, note a variety of irregularities in the reconstructions involving velars in Appendix 1, especially in the Pantar languages. In short, the frequency of irregularities and unexplained occurrences of (post-)velar phonemes shows how limited our understanding of this domain in AP still is, and serves as a reminder that much more extensive reconstruction work needs to be undertaken.

A similar issue is presented by the phonemic velar nasal /{\ng}/ in many AP languages. This phoneme is not reconstructed for pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar}, and is also absent in all of the TK languages. According to \citet{HoltonRobinsonTVhistory}, pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *n became /{\ng}/ in word-final position in all AP languages except Teiwa\il{Teiwa}, where it was retained as /n/. This historical scenario does work well for some languages, for instance, Wersing\il{Wersing}, where [{\ng}] is synchronically a word-final allophone of /n/. However, in other languages, questions remain. For instance, Kamang\il{Kamang} has an unexplained contrast between /{\ng}/ and /n/ in codas (e.g., \textit{ee{\ng}} `\textsc{2sg.poss'} versus \textit{een} `\textsc{2sg.foc'}). Similarly, the existence of /{\ng}/ in coda and medial position in Teiwa\il{Teiwa} is unexplained, as well as the occurrence of /{\ng}/ in other positions than the final one in various languages (e.g. Sar\il{Sar} \textit{la{\ng}ja} `digging stick' and Kula\il{Kula} \textit{{\ng}apa} `father'). 

Vowels also present a major challenge to the reconstruction of the ancestral TAP language. The various vowel systems as illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:3:23} are yet to be historically reconciled with one another. Most AP languages have a length distinction in their vowels: the most common system is 5 short and 5 long cardinal vowels (Kaera\il{Kaera}, Blagar\il{Blagar}, Abui\il{Abui} and Kamang\il{Kamang}), though matching long vowels may be missing in the mid-vowel range (Teiwa\il{Teiwa} and Klon\il{Klon}). Blagar\il{Blagar} has a marginal length distinction with only a small number of items occurring with long vowels \citep{Steinhauerta}, while it is Klon's\il{Klon} short mid-vowels that are marginal. A length distinction is entirely absent from Western Pantar's\il{Western Pantar} and Wersing's\il{Wersing} five vowel system and Adang's\il{Adang} seven vowel system. A relationship, if any, between the mid-vowels in Adang\il{Adang} and length distinctions in other languages remains to be established. Non-cardinal vowels are found in Sawila\il{Sawila} /y, y{\textlengthmark}/ and in Klon\il{Klon} /{\textschwa}/. TK languages all have simple five cardinal vowels and there is a marginal length distinction in only one language, Makalero\il{Makalero}. Stress in conjunction with length appears to have played an important role in vowel histories. For instance, Klon\il{Klon} /{\textschwa}/ seems to originate in a short, unstressed pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *a (e.g., Klon\il{Klon} \textit{{\textschwa}bi} appears to go back to pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *ha{\textprimstress}bi `fish'). In Wersing\il{Wersing}, historically short unstressed vowels are lost in words with long vowels, which in turn become short stressed vowels (e.g., Wersing\il{Wersing} \textit{tlam} appears to go back to pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} *tala{\textlengthmark}m `six', cf. Abui\il{Abui} \textit{tala{\textlengthmark}ma}). In short, much careful bottom-up reconstructive work needs to be done in order to reconcile these different systems to a single ancestral system (see \citealt{Heston2016} for a more complete stress-related account of Klon /ə/ and \citealt{Hestonforthcoming} for a preliminary reconstruction of pTAP vowels).

In sum, with the positive establishment of the relatedness of the Papuan languages scattered across the islands of Timor, Kisar, Alor, Pantar and the Pantar Straits, a start has been made towards a history of the TAP languages. However, we are still a long way off a complete and nuanced understanding of the family and its development (cf. \citeauthor{SchapperEtAl2012}'s (\citeyear{SchapperEtAl2012}) statement of prospective research questions). It will be the task of future reconstructive historical work to definitively solve remaining issues in the comparative data.

The orthographic conventions used in the Appendices are the following: `\emph{\textup{{\Tilde}' joins morphological variants of the same lexeme. In Appendix \ref{sec:3:app:1} and Appendix \ref{sec:3:app:2}, material given in round brackets `( )' represents fossilized morphology or other unetymological material. In Appendix \ref{sec:3:app:3}, round brackets indicate that a given phoneme cannot be reconstructed with absolute certainty. Furthermore, `N' is used to represent an unspecified nasal; `L' an unspecified liquid, and `Q' a putative postvelar stop for which we have only very weak evidence. An empty slot in the pTAP\il{proto-Timor Alor Pantar} column means that the reconstructed pAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} and pTIM\il{proto-Timor} forms, although clearly cognate, are too different to allow for a secure pTAP\il{proto-Alor-Pantar} reconstruction.} }

\textsuperscript{1} This reconstruction must be viewed as tentative, since Kabola\ilt{Kabola} does not make part of the existing pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} reconstruction.  

\textsuperscript{2} Note the loss of the initial syllable in several of the daughter languages. According to \citet{HoltonEtAl2012} and \citet{HoltonRobinsonTVhistory}, this has to do with stress being based on syllable weight. The heavy *bar syllable attracts stress, which leads to the loss of the initial syllable. A similar case is, possibly, pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *tei `tree'.}

\textsuperscript{1} This is a reciprocal term. The reflexes in the modern languages denote either `grandparent' or `grandchild'.  

\textsuperscript{2} Reciprocal grandparent-grandchild term.

\textsuperscript{3} Denotes `grandchild'.  

\textsuperscript{4} Denotes `grandparent'.  

\textsuperscript{5} While clearly cognate, the forms in this set show a variety of unexpected or irregular sound changes: Teiwa\ilt{Teiwa}, Nedebang\ilt{Nedebang} and Kaera\ilt{Kaera} normally reflect pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *l as /l/ in initial and medial position, rather than /j/; Teiwa\ilt{Teiwa} and Nedebang\ilt{Nedebang} normally reflect pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *g as /{\pharfric}/ and /x/, respectively, in medial position, rather than /g/; pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *g is normally reflected as /g/ in Klon\ilt{Klon} and /j/ in Sawila\ilt{Sawila}; and finally, initial /h/ in Western Pantar\ilt{Western Pantar} is usually a reflex of pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *h, rather than *w. The pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} reconstruction must thus be seen as somewhat tentative.

\textsuperscript{1} \citet{HoltonEtAl2012} reconstruct *jari for `laugh'. We revise this form on the basis of the clear presence of a medial velar in the reflexes of many AP languages. Note, however, the irregular loss of reflexes of pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *g in Western Pantar\ilt{Western Pantar}, Kui\ilt{Kui}, Sawila\ilt{Sawila} and Wersing\ilt{Wersing}.  

\textsuperscript{2} See \citet{SchapperTVelevation} for details on this reconstruction.  

\textsuperscript{3} The reflexes of this form denote `game' or `meat'. Note that there are several irregularities in this set: Adang\ilt{Adang} normally reflects pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *r as /l/, rather than /r/; and Sawila\ilt{Sawila} and Wersing\ilt{Wersing} normally reflect *s as /t/, rather than /s/.  

\textsuperscript{4} Abui\ilt{Abui} normally reflects pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *b as /f/, rather than /b/, and pAP\ilt{proto-Alor-Pantar} *b is usually reflected in Kamang\ilt{Kamang} as /p/, rather than /b/.

\textsuperscript{1} Denotes `coast'. The relationship between the two senses is explained by the typical settlement patterns in the region: older settlements are located in high places, often on top of knolls or ridges, whilst newer settlements are downhill towards the coast.

\textsuperscript{1} This item shows metathesis\is{metathesis}: \textit{waen} {\textless} *awen following on fusion from the two halves of the reconstructed doublet.  

\textsuperscript{2} The Bunaq\il{Bunaq} cognate for the second half of this lexical doublet is \textit{g-io} `3\textsc{inal}-faeces', but it doesn't appear in a doublet with \textit{ozo} `faeces'.  

\textsuperscript{3} Semantic shift to `belly'.  

\textsuperscript{4} The final glottal stop in Bunaq\il{Bunaq} is likely a reflex of final *k in pTIM\il{proto-Timor}. However, more evidence is needed to substantiate this claim of relatedness.

\textsuperscript{1} Semantic shift to mean `knee'.  

\textsuperscript{2} The reflex of pTIM\ilt{proto-Timor} *f as /h/ in Makasae\ilt{Makasae} and {\O} in Fataluku\ilt{Fataluku} and Oirata\ilt{Oirata} is irregular; /f/ is expected for Makasae\ilt{Makasae} and Fataluku\ilt{Fataluku}, and /p/ for Oirata\ilt{Oirata}.  

\textsuperscript{3} Semantic shift to `gable, top of house'.  

\textsuperscript{4} This item appears to show metathesis\ist{metathesis} in the following stages: pTIM\ilt{proto-Timor} *-muni {\textgreater} *-minu {\textgreater} *-imun {\textgreater} *-inum {\textgreater} Bunaq\ilt{Bunaq} \textit{{}-inup} `nose'. The change of *m to Bunaq\ilt{Bunaq} p is explainable as the result of /m/ being prohibited from codas in Bunaq\ilt{Bunaq}.  

\textsuperscript{5} The suffix -\textit{kai} is frequently found in body part terms in Makasae\ilt{Makasae}. 
 
 \textsuperscript{6} It seems likely that medial *p changes to /w/ in Bunaq\ilt{Bunaq}. However, we currently lack sufficient data to support this conclusion. There has also been a semantic shift to `foreigner'.

  \textsuperscript{4} It seems likely that initially before front vowels *f changes to /w/ in Bunaq\ilt{Bunaq}. However, we currently lack sufficient data to support this conclusion. 

\textsuperscript{5}~The meaning of the compound \textit{su-amulafu} is not quite clear. It seems to refer to a large sea creature, possibly a dolphin or a dugong. The second element, \textit{amulafu}, translates as `human being, person'. 

 \textsuperscript{6} This form is glossed as either  `shark' or `dugong' in the different Fataluku\ilt{Fataluku} sources.
